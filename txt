I'm gonna be honest, I'm very divided on this situation I work construction and am listed as a "essential worker" in the city. I am working downtown Toronto (the hotbed for SARS) I dont work with medical safety equipment, but I work with construction safety, which, in theory, should be more idiot proof then medical supplies. And anyone that has some sort of connection experience, should be able to pick out miss use of safety gear from the second they walk on to a jobsite with 100 plus workers. I personally, have totally changed my cleaning habits, especially at work, but I did that about 2 weeks ago, I bought a thing of lysol wipes for in side my tool box. I know I'm hypocritical in saying this, people wearing masks IS a good start. At the very least, it stops people from touching their nose or mouth. I may also be kinda bitter, because I am now required to wear a "bandana" (it has many variations) over my mouth and nose, as well as a full face shield that clips onto my hard hat. I feel it's not sufficient, but since I'm listed as an essential service,  I'm not actually guaranteed a job if I want to take time off. It's a really serious "damned if you do, damned if you dont" situation
My wife and kid both have pretty bad asthma so none of this puts me at ease.... I work at a hospital and Lysol the shit out of my shoes every day. When it's not raining I leave them outside.
RT @lospring91: I donated instead of posting a pic for the #CoachesChallenge happening on social media. I donated to the CDC Foundation to help protect healthcare workers, like those who serve our athletics teams when we're in session, who need ppe.

"Trump: hey CEOs! I just figured out the perfect platform for you to talk directly with Americans to boost your sales in this time of crisis! I have more viewers than The Bachelor!

Meanwhile here I am hoping I can find a single can of Lysol and a single 12 pack of toilet paper at the grocery store."
Why would people spray Lysol when wipes are a superior product?

Since the Covid-19, I been more paranoid & overprotective w/my 4boys & Fred. Call me crazy, but when Fred goes out, he wears the entire gear. Gloves, face mask, wipes & Lysol. If I was able to get my hands on this outfit to protect him, best believe he would be in Soma wearing it
"interesting that 5 days ago, naomi's friend \\_amandapetersen made a post about thinking everything over and deciding to stay in new york AFTER she thought she had a mild case of covid-19 saying, ""being sick sucked - it sucked so much more than quarantining and homeschooling and working from home all in the same room does, and if all i have to do to keep my family safe is to lock up inside the walls of our tiny house and lysol every bag that comes through our front door, i can do that. we decided for now, we commit to stay."" hmmmm

ETA: i don't like her and find it annoying she felt the need to make a whole post about staying when most people are just...staying"

They did bigly mishandle this. And I am sure they still are miss handling it. Problem people American people are fucking stupid and if you give them a racial target they will seize on it. I don't know if you saw an African American man spraying Lysol because an Asian man was standing to close on the NYC train for example. While I agree with your sentiment of you fucked up now own it.

March 31, 2020, 2:14 pm | Angela Laury Shaw, Shannon M. Coleman, Anirudh Naig AMES, Iowa -- Over the past month, false information about COVID-19 and food and food packaging has been reported in the media, websites and blogs and shared through social media, note food safety and nutrition and wellness specialists with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach. Angela Shaw, Anirudh Naig and Shannon Coleman want Iowans to know there is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through food and food packaging. Shaw is a food safety state specialist and associate professor in the ISU Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition. Naig is a food safety state specialist and associate professor in the ISU Department of Apparel, Events and Hospitality Management. Coleman is an assistant professor and nutrition and wellness state specialist in the ISU Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition. The ISU Extension and Outreach specialists said the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, and the European Food Safety Authority are in full agreement that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 has spread through food or food packaging. Previous coronavirus epidemics likewise showed no evidence of having been spread through food or packaging. In addition, according to the CDC, currently, there is no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods, and there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. â€œUnlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like Norovirus and Hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness and not food poisioning, and foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission,â€ Shaw said. Naig said it may be possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Coleman noted that the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. â€œThe CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. CDC recommends routine cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops and doorknobs. There is a list of approved disinfectants available on the EPA website. These disinfectants include Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (all scents) and Chlorox Germicidal Bleach,â€ Coleman said. The extension specialists agree there is no need to clean and/or sanitize the outside of food packaging or use non-food grade detergents to wash food to prevent contamination of COVID-19. Handwashing and social distancing remain the top recommendations for consumers to remain safe. â€œIt is not recommended to wash produce with soap, as it can cause vomiting and diarrhea and make consumers very sick,â€ Shaw added.

NTB. Spraying Lysol at her is a teensy bit of a butthole move (I'm biased because an accidental face full of Lysol has sent me to the ER), but it is outweighed by how colossal of a butt she was being. Swap the genders - what would you suggest a female friend would do if she broke up with her boyfriend and he reacted the way your girlfriend did? Would you say she was in any way TB for breaking up?

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member shared the activity that's making her "happy for now." Amid the uncertainty that has come with the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Kyle Richards is calming her nerves in the kitchen. "Today I have felt anxious," The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member captioned an Instagram Story video of the meal she was preparing. "But cooking makes me feel better." "I'm making lasagna [and] this pasta with shrimp and bell pepper sauce," she said in the video as the showed the meal. "So that's making me happy for now. I can't think about what I'm going to look like when this is all said and done, but I'm a really good chef. Just saying." Kyle recently opened up about how she is keeping busy while self-isolating with her family amid the pandemic. â€œWe have been home cooking, cleaning, eating, watching movies, and starting to get a little stir-crazy already,â€ she said at the time. â€œI asked my daughter to take a video of me washing my hands to send you, because you said you wanted that, and she said that if that's entertainment, we're really in a scary position right now, so there's no video of me washing my hands.â€ The global health crisis has been an ongoing source of stress for Kyle. In early March, she shared her shock when she went to a local CVS in search of cleaning supplies only to find nearly bare shelves. "So all of the Lysol and Lysol wipes are gone," she said, still keeping her humor while holding one of the store's notoriously lengthy receipts and adding, "If your local CVS is out of toilet paper, there's always this."

Strip in the garage. Clothes straight into the washer with Lysol laundry sanitizer. Then straight into the shower. I wear different shoes to work which stay in the garage. I've also been wearing a cloth mask at home and limiting contact as much as possible, which is hard since my kids are 4 and 8 months. Strongly considering going to live with a friend who lives alone for the next few weeks.

Went to geezer hour at Walmart this AM. Amazing the number of people that use no protection at all. 350 lb. gentlemen in a power shopping cart, shorts, t shirt, no gloves no mask. People 1 foot apart catching up on the latest gossip. Shopping rules I live by. Long sleeve shirt, jeans, socks, leather shoes, gloves, mask. Small spray bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide, and wipes. Load items in the back of my SUV and spray down the baggage. Spray gloves, remove mask and spray it, Wipe steering wheel. and seat with Lysol wipes. Remove items in garage, spray everything with either the H P or Lysol spray before bringing them in the house. Wipe all items with wipes before storing. Remove all clothing and shoes ans wash clothes. Wash fruits and veggies and bag. Extreme yes, but yesterday I talked to a business associate living in New York city.

YPulse is carefully monitoring COVID-19's impact on young consumers and how brands can respond. We'll be providing new data and insights for you weekly to cope with the crisis, including special reports, exclusive data on Coronavirus and the next generations, and actionable insights on what brands need to be doing now. While the crisis means financial uncertainty for many, some industries are actually getting a pandemic-related boost thanks to isolated young consumersâ€¦ Our COVID-19 data shows that 93% of 13-39-year-olds are being impacted by Coronavirus â€”and the majority are quarantined at home. As young adults implement social distancing into their daily lives, many of them are starting to settle into the â€œnew normâ€ of quarantining and self-isolation. Though the financial impacts of the pandemic are growing, seven in ten Gen Z and Millennials tell us that they feel like they need to stock up on food and supplies to survive the Coronavirus crisis. This stockpiling behavior has led to a run on some productsâ€”most obviously cleaning product companies like Clorox and Lysol, hand sanitizer brands, as well as toilet paper. All have seen a massive spike in sales leading, to a shortage in the supplies globally. Canned goods companies are of course also seeing an impact. Goya Foods has reported a dramatic increase in sales : black beans, pinto beans, and other canned products have spiked as much as 400%. In the last few weeks, they've had to deliver 24 million cans to retailers. But these are far from the only industries seeing their sales skyrocket. As young consumers spend more time at home, they're finding various ways to keep themselves occupied and entertained â€”and it's absolutely impacting their spending. Gen Z and Millennials told us what they can't survive quarantine without and our exclusive research on their COVID-19 purchases shows that they're shifting their spending to the â€œessentialsâ€â€”traditional and nonâ€”that they feel will get them through this trying time. This behavior is leading to serious pandemic-related booms for brands across many industries. Here are some seeing products fly off real and digital shelves as young consumers try to stay fed, occupied, distracted, and comfortable through quarantine: Video GamesAccording to a Verizon report, gaming has seen a 75% weekly increase since the beginning of March. Twitch saw a 10% surge in viewership, while online gaming platform Stream broke a new record when 20 million logged in at the same time over the weekend. During the same time, Nintendo and XBox experienced hours-long server outages due to user overload. Nintendo Switch consoles are selling out everywhere â€”and we wrote about how gamers can't get enough of Switch's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which is already being projected as their most successful launch. Even mobile gaming has seen a 24% increase, according to a report from AdColony. PokÃ©mon Go modified their format so users can play from home which led to a 67% jump in spendingâ€”and some developers are offering games at discounted prices or for free to encourage young gamers to stay indoors. YPulse's State of Gaming research found that 73% of 13-36-year-olds were already playing video games weekly prior to the pandemicâ€”and 45% tell us they are playing video games/mobile games MORE because of COVID-19. Puzzles & GamesNot everyone is turning to streaming or gaming while they're self-isolating. Some young consumers are unplugging with old-fashioned jigsaw puzzles. Big companies like Amazon are selling out of puzzles, while Missouri-based Puzzle Warehouse has been backordering their sets. On a normal day, the Puzzle Warehouse sells 1,000 puzzles, but since the start of the pandemicâ€”they have been selling 10,000 puzzles per day online. According to puzzle giant Ravensburger, their sales are up 370% in North America. YPulse's Playtime research found that 37% of 13-39-year-olds were playing puzzles regularly before the pandemic even began, and also clearly shows that it's given the category a boost: 60% of quarantined young consumers say they have or will buy leisure activity items (e.g. games, puzzles, coloring books) because of Coronavirus.

Infamous Trump supporters Diamond and Silk believe the media is inflating coronavirus statistics to make the administration look bad. The duo, born Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson and who â€” according to the Hollywood Reporter, are paid by Fox News Media to license weekly videos â€” made the claims during a Facebook Live session on Sunday, March 29. â€œIn a matter of two weeks, over 1,000 people supposedly died from the coronavirus. In a two-weeks time period, over 1,000 people â€” after being tested positive â€” have died from the coronavirus, but it took 39 days, from January all the way up to February the 29th, I believe, for the first person to die,â€ Silk read from her notes. Diamond and Silk believe the media is conspiring against President Donald Trump. (Photo: Screenshot/Twitter) After Diamond expressed her approval, Silk continued to rattle off data. â€œMy president said on March the 24th, Tuesday this past week, my president said that he would love for America to be back up and running,â€ Silk continued. â€œI knew this was gon' happen. I knew after he said this this was gon' happen. Go ahead,â€ Diamond interjected. Diamond Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) March 30, 2020 Silk responded with the pair's â€˜Rona conspiracy theory. â€œAt the time, he said it there was 25,489 cases with 307 deaths. Instantaneously, you had the media calling President Trump out, he want it open by Easter, he want this open by Easter â€” me and you was talking, I said now watch the number of deaths go up,â€ Silk said. â€œWatch everything increase because they want to make it look bad in front of our eyes.â€ There were 52,976 diagnoses and 704 deaths by 9 p.m. on March 24, according to CNN. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were more than 177,000 diagnoses and more than 3,400 deaths â€” more deaths than from the 9/11 terror attacks, according to USA Today. Diamond and Silk's critics were appalled by their assertions. We, The African American legion, would like to trade @DiamondandSilk for a bottle of hand sanitizer. Off brand is fine. #DiamondandSilk pic.twitter.com/tW1U3VRWNt â€” The TV Guy (@The_TV_FAN) March 31, 2020 â€œDiamond and Silk exist as a profitable vehicle for scared, racist old white people to pretend black people are included,â€ wrote one person. â€œDiamond and Silk aka Poly and Ester need to STFU,â€ demanded another. â€œWhen I saw them trending, I knew it was about some bullshit.â€ â€œBlack delegations will gladly trade Diamond and Silk for an entire warehouse full of Clorox and Lysol,â€ suggested one more. @DiamondandSilk = modern day #minstrelshow. Sadly if white folks can't do Al Jolson/Jim Crow routines themselves they luv to see black folks act like buffoons, i.e; #DiamondandSilk @WhitlockJason @RealCandaceO @ravensymone , â€¦ it's more disturbing than Joaquin Phoenix in joker â€” john locke (@johnloc65740908) March 31, 2020

No, I've been doing so as precaution (and this includes working from home). I plan on continuing this until at least the start of May, and I understand that this still carries risk. I've also been hand washing, not touching my face, and disinfecting surfaces (somehow our local WalMart still has Lysol).
"This depends on if you are a health worker, a caregiver for someone who is sick, or a layperson/civilian/term that isn't insulting for a person with normal risk factors. 

For a person with normal risk factors, I would invest in many cloth type masks and wash them after every use, probably on hot and tumble dry on hot.  Definitely not Lysol or alcohol; I sincerely doubt the benefits outweigh the damage to the mask"

"Keep protecting yourself then, but don't count on other people to be responsible. A lot of them won't be. And any one of them could be infected and passing it to you in just sneezing somewhere on that bottle of Lysol you just picked up from the aisle. 

You can't project how other people will react (a lot are very much in denial right now, catching at any straw that tells them that they or their loved ones aren't in the vulnerable population - for example that *certainty* that young people or children aren't affected...)

Containment will help slow it down, if enforced. If not, eventually, after enough deaths, something might come up to help the survivors with it - a working treatment after the most feeble people die of it, a vaccine in a year or two, more social distancing etc. Who knows how the world will look like after something like that, though."

Oh goodness, don't spray Lysol in your car!!! Of course you're having breathing issues. I can't use bleach-based products at all. When I could, I'd have to leave the house after cleaning the bathroom, leaving the fan running, for a few hours. Then the reactions became too severe and I can't at all. Covid-19 hates alcohol. If you need to disinfect, try to use rubbing alcohol instead of bleach products.

"If you're looking to kill the SARS-2-CoV virus (COVID-19 is not actually a virus), your best bet is 70%+ ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Effectiveness drops of rapidly below that. 
        
1/2 cup of bleach to a gallon of water will also do, but is not as fast, and may cause other problems, like corrosion and... bleaching. 
       
Also - ventilation is key if you are using bleach. If you're inhaling a lot of chlorine (or any other form of badness) you increase your chances of being a severe case if you do contract the virus. Now is definitely the time to be taking care of your lungs. 
       
Lysol is also excellent, if you can get it. 
         
The SARS-2-CoV cirus is actually really easy to kill as far as viruses go, until it's living in your cells."

March 31, 2020 â€“ Miami, FL â€“ It's been barely 2 weeks since school has shut down physical doors nationwide and if you're like me most of your incoming emails these days revolve around COVID 19. Some pledge to keep you â€œup to dateâ€ with the latest news; others give tips on how to stay sane indoors and keep kids entertained yet active in schoolwork. I'm pretty sure that none of them have spoken to people yet on what to do after weathering this storm and how to return to a sense of normalcy. I'm happy to try and fill that void â€“ at least as it relates to head lice. Seriously, in a world where head lice outbreaks have always been a top concern what makes us think that problem will dissipate once the immediate threat of the coronavirus has passed? While kids and teachers may not be in school now, they'll soon return (God willing, right?) and unless mom and dad have actively sought ways to treat a lice infestation at home, kids who can't wait to bond with their BFF's again will soon be sharing and spreading lice. Lysol and bleach don't work on these suckers â€“ sorry. We're educating people on how to identify if someone in their household has lice, because in confined quarters as we are now lice will just keep getting passed around on hairbrushes, when playing Twister, and watching movies together on the sofa â€“ it's imminent with all this close contact. DIY kits are available for purchase for $95 (a savings of $55) with FREE no-contact delivery and they come with a guide on how to navigate removing lice yourself. We know it's not easy without professional help, but it's worth a shot instead of allowing lice to hatch and lay more eggs in your home. A third option is giving people peace of mind that our treatment centers are uber-sanitized and that yes, we are still taking appointments scheduled 1 hour apart from each family. Bottom line is this â€“ if nothing is done to treat a case of head lice and at least curb infestation in the home, what kind of lice nightmare is going to be unleashed when we have our freedom back? When children can have sleepovers again? When playgrounds and schools are back in operation? Parents â€“ are you paying attention?! After all of the necessary restrictions due to COVID 19 it's going to be hard to contain your children from having close contact with each other (#1 way lice get transmitted). So we ask you to help us help you be responsible and get treated now before lice multiply and you have a full blown case. If you've ever seen a bunch of tiny paralyzed brown bugs removed on some paper towels you know it's nasty ya'll. But that's what we do. We tackle the work of lice removal and do it all with a smile on our faces, while keeping your loved ones safe and happy. We'd just rather not have thousands of you to serve at one time with extreme cases because we want to do our very best and be thorough with each client. As a professional in this industry, I can foresee the spike in demand for our services as soon as the coronavirus is no longer an active threat and we're prepared with stock and supplies so we'll be ready for you. But instead of spending a day in our albeit lovely lice removal clinic watching Netflix, wouldn't you rather be at the beach again (finally!)? Consider this: Getting treated now (when you can) will help you save time in the future.

I have been watching closely Wuhan on YouTube since Mid January 2020. The corona 19 was born Mid December one month before Highly contagious and it will spread rapidly originally I thought social distancing, but better yet full quarantine is our best attempt at slowing this down and saving ourselves. Hospitals doctors, nurses, first responders can't jeopardize them and their families! We need to be responsible for ourselves! We need to take care as best as we can, stock up, stay clean, hygiene! Listerine mouthwash! washing things, beds and when you do white wash add bleach. I also have a spray bottle with water bleach and a disinfectant, like Mr Clean. I also think it's how much we inhale so if we keep our beds fresh and limit what we take in will help us stay healthy. Clean light switches, hair brushes, remote controls anything you touch! I use alcohol infused baby wipes in the car to wipe down key pads and gas pumps as well Lysol spay your shoes before you get back in the car. Change air duct filters at home It's not surviving the virus, it's surviving the lung disease Don't go to hospital or doctors offices!Unless you want to really catch it! There will be no doctors or nurses, no supplies! They will take you out of circulation, I recommended to self quarantine in the comfort of your own home and I would start now! Lead people away from hospitals set up infectious disease facilities I really don't want to tell you the next step!!! So try hard to take care of yourself

My family has a big group Facebook private message, involving 8 people. We have been going back and forth about how things are going where we all live- five different states in the u.s. well over the weekend I was asked about how things are where I am, so I spouted off the latest statistics/ predictions from my health departments most recent press conference. And my step mom told me she didn't believe me, and was pretty rude. So I lost it on her, and said that all these people must be wrong along with links where the experts were taking about it, told her I was tired of her treating me like I was dumb, when she doesn't do that to the others in the group, and I wasn't going to put up with it anymore. She has done this to me at least 3 times in the last year. All in front of others. And I left the group. I get several messages from my sister and dad about it which I don't answer until the next day. Told my dad all my thoughts, I doubt he said anything to the wicked witch of the Midwest, because she never believes she has to apologize. And then my sister tells me that â€œthe interaction stresses her outâ€. And we need to talk about it. Ummmm you are the golden child, so what do you care? But she isn't available until later in the week. And my dad? Trying to be the peacemaker tells me I just need to get used being the scapegoat and deal with it, and then insists I be added back to the dumb thing. I haven't decided how to handle that so right now I'm ignoring it. What's making it worse is she keeps sending me videos of paranoid people saying to spray your groceries with Lysol and soak your produce in soapy water.

Very unlikely, like one in a 6 billion chance. What we know so far is that it probably doesn't last on a surface more than a few hours. But, to ease any anxiety, before picking up your package, disinfect with Lysol or whatever you have. You're more likely to get coronavirus from your mail person versus from Toreba.

My sister sprays her grocery bags w/ Lysol to kill coronavirus before bringing them in the house to kill coronavirus. I still question if this is necessary. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ https://www.sciencealert.com/food-safety-expert-explains-how-to-safely-deal-with-groceries-during-the-pandemic
@l3l2ucelee Lysol wipes say they kill coronavirus too. Many strains under the same name.
"Paper products - opening, since most 24/7 hour stores seem to have switched.  

Wipes; alcohol and a lot of everything else - â€œ2pmâ€ truck which might not get done for a few hours after 2. 

At least this is at Walmart - currently there is no system in place to grab these items off the line and put them aside, there are limits, but the 4 or so packages of Lysol and Wipes are gone as soon as the truck is done and pallets hit the floor. Yesterday they did pull some products aside for today's senior shopping hour.

Could be different, at one Walmart one might put those products on the floor as soon as they come off the truck, but there is no nationwide policy."

Nananawagan ang Lung Center of the Philippines sa publiko na mag-donate ng bleaching agents na maaaring gamitin para ma-sanitize ang kanilang mga laboratoryo at mga kwarto ng pasyenteng mayroong coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ayon kay Dr. Norbert Francisco, tagapagsalita ng Lung Center, kinakailangan nila ng nasa 100 galon ng bleaching agents gaya ng Clorox o Lysol kada buwan upang mamentena ang kalinisan sa 66 na kwarto na nakalaan sa mga COVID-19 patients. Giit ni Francisco, hindi pwedeng ordinaryong linis ang gagawin sa mga kwarto na ginamit ng pasyenteng dinapuan ng naturang sakit lalo na aniya ngayon na nagsisimula ang kanilang COVID testing laboratory kaya't kailangan ng matinding paglilinis dito. Ani Francisco, mayroong isang machine ang ospital na kayang mag-analisa ng 40 samples mula sa mga pasyenteng pinaghihinalaang may COVID-19 sa loob ng 10 oras.
There are several cases of covid 19 being confirmed at my grocery store in South Florida this week. All they did as preventative measures afterward was have some people you could find at home depot in t shirts come in and wipe about 1/5th of the store down with some lysol wipes. It's too late to take this seriously

Well if anyone would take a moment to read the back a lysol can...it clearly stated Corona Virus. So it is really completely a historical government failure.

The only thing I have noticed with the curb crushing mandated stays, is our country is divided and that in itself can be as toxic as any pandemic. This is a human problem not a left v right problem. It's a human thing. Btw it clearly states Corona Virus on the back of a Lysol can. That's not new labeling, that's just normal Americans assuming we are safe based on what???

Unfortunately the virus did in fact exist. Its printed on the back of a Lysol can. Not that anyone reads anything anymore. When you take care of high risk people one tends to notice those HUGE details in fine print.

I'm in the same boat. I work at a ma and pa shop in my town. We're like a family, and I have no ill will toward my employers, BUT... I almost rage quit today. Then I remembered that I have no security net, I have no savings, and my only family (other than my 2 yr old son) is my estranged and abusive adopted family. You would not believe how many people are just acting like nothing has changed. The lottery junkies still come in 5-20+ times a day. We placed an extra barrier to create distance at the counter and people literally lean over it! People sneezing, coughing, picking a bunch of stuff up and setting it back down. I have a sore throat from all the bleach, rubbing alcohol and lysol I use at work to try to keep everything clean. Theres only 1 person running the store at a time, so I can't keep up on it like I want. Some people come in just to chat or browse and then leave without getting anything. People I used to respect have tried to convince me it's all a hoax. One lady threatened to come in and cough on and kill my coworker, if she got COVID-19. We're seeing both the best and the worst in people rn.

Everyone in my area has been coughing cause of pollen allergies.
I actually got sick.
I thought it could be the virus.
I went online and looked up the COVID-19 checklist.
Thank God I didn't have the virus and all the symptoms.
I stopped delivering a week ago.

Whomever is still delivering out there, take special precautions!!!
Healthy people of all ages are dying.
Shower as soon as you get home.
Leave shoes at door or outside and spray with Lysol.

Wow, this is scary. She has taken it upon herself to change clothing etc. as you've stated. Scrubs go in a bag changed at work and then immediately in the wash. Her car gets wiped down fully with Lysol wipes Everytime she gets in and out. N95s are out of the question right now - she is only getting a single surgical mask per shift which seems crazy to me... Thanks for the tips I guess, as gloom and doom as this whole situation is. Local hotels have offered free rooms to healthcare workers to isolate from family. For now, myself and our son have moved in with my elderly parents (one of which is not entirely healthy) and she comes to visit a couple times a week, outside only, more than 6ft apart. It's killing her not to be able to hug our son but obviously a small price to pay for not killing my parents or passing this on...
It must vary by station. We have masks, gloves, Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer available to us at our station. And mini refillable bottles to take hand sanitizer with us on our route.
Woodmans East had a bunch of Lysol spray when I went on Sunday afternoon. No wipes.

You're not interacting with all of the other people that are in the grocery store, and if you're careful and have cleaning supplies, you can do a pretty good job of ensuring that you dont catch the virus from surfaces. Clean off the perishable stuff with lysol or whatever you have, let the nonperishable stuff sit for 3 days. You can take all the precautions in the world while you're shopping at a store, but if you happen to walk through an area someone just coughed in, you're still fucked.

The thing I don't get about all of these conspiracy theories about COVID 19 is, who is supposed to be benefiting from this? This is going to have a devastating impact on literally everyone.

Movie theatres are selling popcorn to a line of cars for God's sake...that lady doesn't lysol or wash between every debit card and then scooping popcorn. Walmarts packed, dollar stores packed, movie theatre still selling popcorn, engineering firms that do commercial work that won't be built for two years are open, pets mart still grooming pups, and thrift stores and other places are all making sure they are essential somehow. The whole county/city I'm in are under lock down but no one's listening. Havent even heard a word from my employer about this but I got a fucking email from 7/11 gas station on their response...

I've got a relative who works at WallyWorld - says warehouses are dumping inventory. "Surprise" trucks with loads of pallets of shit that isn't in high demand. But a lot of the high demand stuff (iso, tp, lysol, etc) just sits in the back until they close so they can at least stock it on the shelves safely. It'll be gone within minutes after opening.

Lysol specifically might be hard to find but a lot of grocery stores have general disinfectant sprays back in stock now. Went to Publix in North Decatur last Sunday and they had a few bottles. General advice has been to go close to when they open (but I went in the afternoon and was fine).
what do yall think will kill me first covid-19 or poisoning from the excessive amount of lysol & bleach I've been using all over everything ?? reply tweet!!
Thought you might appreciate this, from a veterinarian friend: PSA from a veterinarian. "We learn about virology, epidemiology, disease outbreak response, immunology, biosecurity and aseptic techniques, and zoonotic diseases (transmitted from animals to humans). This is in our wheel house. If animal outbreaks were handled the way this has been handled, your bacon would cost $20/slice. The head of China's CDC is a veterinarian and he is stunned that we are not wearing masks in public): 1) Wear a mask if you have to be near people. The goal of a mask is 90% to protect other people from the infection that you might not even know that you have and 10% to protect yourself. 2) Do NOT spray your mask with Lysol, etc, to "re-sterilize" it. Breathing cleaning product fumes will damage your lungs and set them up for disease. Keep this in mind when you are obsessively cleaning in general - spraying and wiping absolutely everything could expose your lungs to harmful chemicals. Items that sit for a few hours will most likely have little to no live virus left (I can't guarantee this, but it is probable based on how enveloped viruses behave and what Dr. Fauci has said). 3) If you use a cloth mask, swap out and wash if it gets damp (it will). Remove elastic and HEPA insert if you have one, ideally, replace the filter once the mask is clean and dry. It might help to put a used filter out in the sun as UV kills a lot, but I can't tell you for sure that will work - last resort. You can also put extra fabric inside the mask, anything that traps droplets, but it will also make it hotter and a wet mask can wick virus from the outside to the inside and vice versa. Store in clean paper bag so that any remaining virus can dry out and die. 4) Wash hands before and after putting mask on or off and do not touch your face. Assume that the mask is contaminated if it has been worn and proceed accordingly. 5) STFH (First word: "Stay", Last word: "Home") OK to copy and paste from an "Anonymous Veterinarian" since I don't want to be liable, these are my educated suggestions only."

We've only really been in this "safer at home" thing for about 2.5 weeks, March has been a VERY long month I really hope April is better but I know it will be worse. We are not even close to the peak, which is projected to be in May. Please let your friends and family and everyone you know to please stay at home and to not visit family members unless absolutely necessary. Los Angeles hospitals are already beginning to fill up and we have a whole 2-4 months more of this. Let's do this together amigos! :) I hope you all have a wonderful Wednesday! P.S. does anyone know where I can get some lysol disinfectant spray and a large hand sanitizer? My roommate is an ICU nurse and has been taking care of ONLY coronavirus patients for the whole month and we are almost out
This sounds about right. I had a container of Lysol wipes on my car's trunk the other day and a random cop said â€œyou need to put those away before some steals them.â€

You think coronavirus is going away... ? There's going to magically come a day when everyone is like, â€œok guys, coronavirus is gone, nothing to worry about, you can just forget about all that mass hysteria we instilled in you about hand sanitizer and Lysol spray and disinfecting everything you touch and washing your hands 20x a day, don't need to do that anymore, coronavirus is gone forever and never coming back!!â€ Do you think anything like that will ever happen? This is just regular life now. It's already ingrained into society. It's already apart of every day life. Coronavirus isn't going away, nor are infectious diseases, and everyone's recognition of those things is now permanently heightened, and that's not going away either.
RT @Vindog56: My wife just emptied two cans of lysol throughout the house, so if that doesn't kill me, I'm more than confident Coronavirus hasn't got a chance

We had to go pick up prescriptions yesterday and we were the only ones wearing masks and gloves. The pharmacist was openly laughing. I sprayed everything down with Lysol and then bleach spray, wiped my hands before and after touching everything and just hope we got out safely. Walmart was packed and nobody was wearing anything, all the gas stations were packed, you'd never know anything different was going on. My wife has asthma and just got over cancer and I have severe sleep apnea and am skinny. We can't afford to play games with this. My father is 86 and doesn't understand what's happening and isn't sure if it's all a hoax or not he said and still eats out his meals and doesn't know how to cook. He said there are people in his building going around and wiping down all door handles twice a day, but everyone in his building are still going out for their meals and walking around in groups or playing golf.
So if covid19 was on Lysol cans all these years wouldn't that mean they already have a remedy for it?? ðŸ¤”

Windows down. Spray your car with Lysol after the rider gets out. We are going to see more of these idiots who refuse to self quarantine when they have symptoms.

RT @CuteCrook: Before #covid19 I love how my city was hand holding, so nice and helpful, let's build homes, & feed families. And now. I have a 65 year old woman running her cart into me for five #Lysol bottles. Here's her photo:
"We will have canopy of something green real soon? A market canopy?  

The Trees cannot keep up with the demands of the worlds Toilet Paper needs in the long term. The pulp industry is being hoaxed into an overhaul? Almost every industry has been dumped â€”to be pumpedâ€” with this hoax. It's all connected. It has always been this way. It takes money to make money. The environment 'is' everywhere the Elites go. They breath the same air. Their kid's kids will live here on the Earth and suffer if the Canopy issue is not invested in. I see Hemp as a decent solution (anywhere it will grow). It might be *better* than trees considering all Eco factors and commerce. I'd like to see the 'plan' on paper.

Coronavirus (the cutting, culling and replanting of  vitality) is the economic reset, of course. Again, think Sun and spring and growth. The seasons of life. It is (like 9/11) based in part on the (Cov)enenant â€”sacrifice. Making sacrifices.  (Some) Economies will soar after the Sync is completed. I still hold out hope that the partly wicked Medical Industry is being hoaxed into controlled demolition. Few in research will notice the potential that the new lot of awakened hoax-busters will be angry about their unwilling humiliation of the 'masked' lie. This could be a masterstroke of PRS with the end goal of dividing the high-maintenance health industry into its holistic alternatives based more gradually in Nature. Hopeful, yes. Plausible, yes. Again, ain't my first Hoax analysis. Time will tell. Hoaxes always eat themselves. 

This same model applies to many markets where the obvious fear-based conclusion gives way to some sensible equity (or un-triggered analysis). The market of fear is the oldest trick in the book. I.e. satan and war, pestilence, plagues, nukes, evil algorithms, impending forced vaccines,etc. 

'If' the veil of FUD is lifted, America will soon be a first-world country? 

Then Oprah will act as the people's president and fake divi the lot? All while the same Hegelian political model will work as needed. 

Cheers."

Freewill not withstanding, how can people be so simple-minded to not see that Trump's "small government" tactic is nothing more than his way of distancing himself from blame, responsibility, and a reason to exert effort? The isolation isn't mitigated by the musings of Fox News with their tip-toeing around their desire to shout some political barb at the "Dems" or kiss the president's ass because that's what they do daily.

"This is the second school leadership staff member I have heard about who was interacting with the public passing something out days before being confirmed infected.  While sad it also highlights how important decontaminating and infection control has become.

For those who are passing out or those receiving tablets and laptops or meals from schools. (or anyone really)

Make sure that the staff passing these things out are wearing protection. Mask and Gloves and that any devices you might be picking up have been wiped down with 70 percent alcohol, or a bleach solution before accepting them , or before and when passing them out.  Most wipes take several minutes of ""wet time"" to do their job.  Make sure to read the labels!!! Very important!   A once over with a lysol wipe may not be doing anything.

I have been working danger close to the virus for a few weeks now and this protocol is EXTREMELY important to avoid spreading infection. I am treating everyone outside my household like they are infected.

If the school is not cleaning the items. DO IT YOURSELF, ON THE SPOT. Put on gloves and wipe and spray that stuff down!"

This post is part of a series authored by theBASICS (Bold Action to Stop Infections in Clinical Settings)team. BASICS is a new initiative that will transform healthcare and reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by at least 50%. This post originally appeared on Kinnos' website on March 26th, and is reposted with permission. We want to make it clear from the start that all aspects of infection prevention are crucial in the response against COVID-19: compliance with social distancing, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), effective hand hygiene, and thorough surface disinfection, and that one isn't necessarily more important than the other. While the media has widely reported on social distancing and (unfortunately severe deficiencies of) PPE and hand sanitizer, we feel that the nuances of surface disinfection are not frequently discussed. And having been in the disinfection space for over 5 years now, we feel pretty competent in talking about it. Kinnos has previously written about the â€œFour C's of Disinfectantsâ€ in a prior blog post and we wanted to revisit some of those aspects here, which will also help people better understand how to use the EPA's list for â€œDisinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2â€. Before we jump into disinfection, let's talk about COVID-19 itself. We know that COVID-19 can be transmitted through aerosolized droplets and that these droplets can land on surfaces and remain viable for hours or days depending on the surface material. We also know that COVID-19 is an enveloped virus, meaning that it's protected by a fatty lipid bilayer. Fatty layers are easily exploited: when you wash your hands with soap, what you're really doing is creating a fat-soluble layer for the virus's fatty layer to bind to so that it'll wash away with the soap. Unlike more robust pathogens like non-enveloped viruses and bacterial spores that contain layers of tough protein, fatty layers are susceptible to bonding with alcohol which causes the fat to un-bond with each other, opening up the envelope and allowing the alcohol to go in and denature proteins. Stronger oxidizing disinfectants, like bleach and hydrogen peroxide, literally rip electrons off molecules to destroy the structure of the pathogen. All of this to say that using a disinfectant to inactivate droplets on surfaces seems like a good way to prevent COVID-19 transmission. With this context, we can look at the Four C's of Disinfectants (Chemistry, Concentration, Contact Time, and Coverage) and why they're important. When we talk about the first three, Chemistry, Concentration, and Contact Time, we really mean 1) what, 2) how much, and 3) how long it takes kill a specific pathogen. For example, the active ingredient in Clorox Healthcare Germicidal Bleach Wipes is 0.55% sodium hypochlorite and it claims a 3-minute contact time against C. difficile spores. In order to go to market, all disinfectants have to submit data to the EPA proving these claims. To be classified as a sanitizer, for instance, the requirement is usually conducting an AOAC- or ASTM-standard test demonstrating a minimum 3-log reduction (e.g. 99.9% reduction, 4-log would be 99.99%, and so on) within 10 minutes on a couple of pathogens. Specifically in the context of COVID-19, we can look at a recent paper that compiled data on the efficacy of disinfectants against enveloped viruses. Sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 0.5% was able to achieve a > 3.0-log reduction in human coronavirus after 1 minute, whereas a 0.06% sodium hypochlorite solution was only able to achieve a 0.4-log reduction in transmissible gastroenteritis virus after the same time period, suggesting that a longer Contact Time than 1 minute is needed for a more diluted bleach solution to effectively kill enveloped viruses or that stronger concentrations should be used in practice. And this is the key point â€“ all the disinfectants you see on the EPA's disinfectant list against COVID-19 have varying concentrations of active ingredients that require a different amount of time to be effective [FN1]. So if we go into the database, we'll see that Micro-kill Bleach Wipes have a 30 second contact time, Sani-Cloth Bleach Wipes have a 1 minute contact time, and Cavicide Bleach has a 3 minute contact time, even though they're all sodium hypochlorite. You'll also notice that many of the quaternary ammonium (â€œquatâ€) disinfectants (which is the active ingredient in household disinfectants like Lysol and what the media means when they say â€œalcoholâ€ because quats are dissolved in alcohol) tend to have longer contact times at the 10 minute mark. As discussed above, it's generally because alcohol breaks down the membrane by bonding and then the quats go in and denature proteins whereas bleach is ripping the virus apart more rapidly via oxidation. One of our gripes with all of the news articles saying that bleach is overkill and that alcohol is sufficient is that they completely neglect the Contact Time. Yes, alcohol can be effective, but often only if you're letting it sit on the surface undisturbed for 10 minutes, in which time the alcohol could evaporate and you may need to reapply. But who's actually sitting there with a timer for 10 minutes and making sure the surface stays wet for that time? For the record, this post is NOT meant to incite fear or to say that your standard quat/alcohol disinfectants can't be effective (you'll notice some bleach products have 10 minute contact times and some quat disinfectants are 3 minutes [FN2]) but the main message here is to help you understand that effectively disinfecting surfaces requires following a process and not just buying a product. It's like that saying: it's how you use it that matters. Finally, there's Coverage, which is pretty intuitive and ties everything back to the importance of process â€“ cover every part of the surface and make sure the surface is covered for the correct Contact Time. Of course, this can be difficult when you're dealing with large surface areas and using a transparent disinfectant, so just try your best to be thorough. It's worth noting that many of the surfaces you tend to disinfect are waterproof, and when you put a liquid on a waterproof surface, it beads up. If beading occurs, you're physically unable to achieve the contact time on every part of that surface. The good news is that more disinfectant manufacturers have been addressing this problem by adding surfactants which lower the surface tension of the liquid to allow it to spread out and cover waterproof surfaces. If you spray or wipe down a dark-colored surface, you should be able to see if your disinfectant is forming beads or not. Normally, this is the part where we pitch you on how Kinnos has developed our HighlightÂ® color additive to solve the Coverage and Contact Time problem, but the intent of this post is to be informational rather than promotional, so just take a look at our website if you're interested. We hope that this post will help people use disinfectants more effectively, and that we can all work more well-informed to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Footnote 1: You might be asking how the EPA has approved all of these disinfectants given that no one has actually been able to run tests specifically against COVID-19, and the answer is that the EPA allows disinfectants to use efficacy against the â€œmost resistant representative virusâ€ to claim efficacy on weaker ones. So if you have approval for a more robust non-enveloped virus, then the assumption is that you can easily kill an enveloped one. That's why the database tells you to follow the instructions for killing things like canine parvovirus, which is a non-enveloped virus. Footnote 2: One of the secrets of the disinfection world is that specific products are marketed for specific use cases. For example, most hospitals use bleach to kill C. difficile spores, which generally has a contact time of 3-4 minutes, and they'll slap that number onto their marketing materials. So even if that bleach product can kill a virus in 1 minute, sometimes the manufacturer will just use a 3 minute contact time (or longer) because they know they can easily pass the required AOAC- or ASTM-standard test at that time point and they're marketing 3 minutes already anyway. To an extent, this is why some of the bleach products may have 10 minute contact times on their EPA labels even though it's generally known that bleach easily destroys enveloped viruses. Even so, always better to follow the instructions for Contact Time on the label of the disinfectant.

I'm sure if this were true someone would have brought it to the attention of @realDonaldTrump by now. And by the way, so does Lysol disinfectant wipes kill the corona virus. I won't be eating any of those anytime soon either. #memorial ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ RT @Jordan_Sather_: Here's your daily reminder that Chlorine Dioxide can kill coronavirus in our environment (studies have proven this), but the FDA refuses to study it internally at safe, low doses to kill coronavirus in humans. Instead, the fake news media attacks people who discuss it, like me.
"What is the time to kill of that disinfectant? A dip and dry is not enough time to kill much of anything.

Look at your cleaning supplies, Lysol requires at least 3 minutes of surface being wet in order to kill the bulk of what it is designed for. Most cleaner are 3 or 10 minutes of staying wet before they are dried in order to kill these bacteria and viruses"
That's true. I was surprised to learn it survived on cardboard for a day. This after I had opened up amazon shopping boxes. Man did I Lysol the f out of everything and then purely on top of it. And clothes went in the washer twice. That was a few weeks ago and I still wonder.
Why is it all I can think about while watching this is what a waste of perfectly good Lysol that we can't find in any sorw around here! LOL! GREAT VIDEO THOUGH!!! RT @RealCandaceO: I really wish @realDonaldTrump would let black people from the hood conduct just one #coronavirus press conference. America needs this more than Dr. Fauci right now.
What section of the @BarackObama Affordable care act provision covers the #coronavirus â“ Lysol couldn't be the only to care ðŸ‘€
The moment the WHO and CDC say that Canines are susceptible to COVID19, you can bet your ass I will be just like Karen (we all know a Karen! The one that cleared the shelves of all the Lysol and TP) and buy every single dog mask on Amazon! Nothing is infecting my Tallulah Belle!
The costcos here in Canada (Vancouver area bc at least) enacted store limits 2 weeks ago, max 50, physical distancing encouraged. Went there yesterday: lineups outside, limits on people inside, handing out wipes, people holding stand 6 ft apart signs, lines on the floor at checkout, they unload your cart while you stand way back, don't touch your card, sanitize area after, more free Lysol wipes at the checkout, checking the receipt and cart there before you can walk out. Oh and distance lines around the service desk. All in all I was quite impressed.
Why did you post that? I didn't say anything about J&J knowing about Covid19. I said old Lysol cans say they kill corona viruses, which is 100% correct.

They sold me an item but never told me about their april 17 return policy. Had I been informed I would not have bought the item. Now when I went to the target store to return the item, I am informed that they are not accepting returns til the 17th. Part of their corona virus policy. Well what about that corona virus policy extending to sales of non essential items. They do nothing to make sure that the items they sell are corona virus free. They gladly take your money no matter what.They clean the store but the items that are on the shelves , that hundreds of hands have touched, they don't lysol those items, they don't clean those items. They ignore the items on the shelves and sell them to you no matter who coughed or sneezed on them without consequence but try to return the item and they're suddenly super safety conscous.

So, if 1+2=3... then why are you defending the fact that asking for gloves and masks is a good idea? (It's not) most likely the hospitals have the majority of the gloves, right? For those people who were worried enough to go out and buy gloves, they probably were worried because they're elderly or immunocompromised or know someone who is. There may be a few people who have an abundance of these supplies but you better believe these people aren't ordering instacart, because these are the people who already bought six whole chickens, all the beef, all the toilet paper, and the entire stock of soup before the coronavirus even hit their state! Asking someone who doesn't have enough to give to others because they wouldn't have enough for themselves is ridiculous. You can't assume everyone has extras, as many probably don't. Besides, those who have major stockpiles generally don't like to share even if they have more than enough, because generally those people are selfish and narcissistic with the thought process of â€œmy life and my comfortability are more important than anyone else'sâ€ *toilet paper stockpilers, I'm ðŸ‘€ at you*. I'll say it one more time. HAND. SANITIZER. I sanitize my hands before i shop and before I put everything in my car and again once I'm done. I deliver the groceries and sanitize my hands again. If you're going to wear a mask you have to wear eye protection too for it to be even close to 99% protective, otherwise your efforts may be wasted. I'll feel bad once all the doctors are sick and no one can treat you or your loved ones when they're hurt/dying... it'll be a very sad day indeed ðŸ˜”. Just one last paragraph. Sanitize your car and stuff too. After I go grocery shopping for myself or my family I unpack everything and then throw away the bags or spray them with Lysol, then wash my hands and wipe off my counters. It's not that hard to do. Oh, and since you have the common sense to understand that 1+2=3... you should also have the common sense to understand that gloves can also carry the virus on them, right? Guess not... seems like 1+1=3 for you ðŸ¥º.
If you're spraying yourself in the face with @Lysol you're likely dense enough that it won't really matter. You're going to get #Covid19 whether you like it or not.
If you're worried about getting the coronavirus from your groceries, you could always cook your food in Lysol instead of vegetable oil. It'd probably be healthier. #notActualAdvice

Disinfecting all the surfaces of your home is more important now than ever. Here are some answers to some of your commonly asked questions .

"You might find these guidelines from the CDC helpful. In the summaries it's mentioned that manual or mechanical cleaning needs to be performed first to ensure thorough sterilization.

[CDC sterilization guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html)

I would imagine a chemical fog is not an efficient solution because pathogens can hide underneath surface dirt and the fog can only get to surfaces where gravity or air currents would carry it. The proper method of sterilization seems to be whatever method provides direct access to surfaces with sterilizing detergents/solutions.

Since you would need to scrub surfaces first to remove dirt, why not use a sterilizing detergent in the manual/mechanical cleaning process? Also it seems a bit impractical and potentially expensive to fog your house on a regular basis.

This kind of cleaning also won't save you if a you are in an enclosed space with a person carrying a viral infection like COVID-19. You most likely would be infected if you come within 15' of the person by water vapor in each exhaled breath or pick it up from a surface near the person exhaling (COVID-19 lives up to 3 hours on surfaces) then touching your face.

If you're prepared to live in a 24/7 constant chemical fog to ensure all exhaled virus is neutralized you've now just developed a nasty illness from said chemical fog and possibly died. It's a little impractical from that side as well. 

A more practical solution is to wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face. All are much cheaper and more effective than a disinfecting fog."

My mom was too busy spraying some Lysol in my room (she's really scared of COVID-19) while I was changing, which might sound weird to a lot of you but it's just kind of a normal occurrence in my house. She took a lot at me and commented how I got â€œthinnerâ€ and explained to her how I have been trying to lose weight (it took almost two years for me to drop 20 pounds). She went on to explain how my boobs also got smaller bc your boobs shrink when you lose a lot of weight and says that as if it was a bad thing. I went through puberty EXTREMELY early (I think by the time I was in first or second grade, I already had C-Cup breasts and had to wear my mom's hand me downs). I don't know why she thought how my boobs got smaller equates it to being a bad thing. She's not against my weight loss journey. It was just kind of unnecessary, especially bc she teases me for being the â€œhealthyâ€ one in the family. (As if I didn't text her a whole novel to her during New Year's eve begging her to stop killing my siblings with daily fast food).

"That happens when respiratory droplets are in the air from a sick person. It won't happen if there is no sick person there breathing or coughing in that space. Also, the droplets only stay in the air for 3 hours. This means that being in a grocery store near people who are sick, breathing the same air as them, is dangerous. 

But you almost certainly won't catch it just from breathing air in a room in your home where your groceries are. If there is no infected person breathing in that room, there is no virus in the air. The real risk with groceries is the virus staying on the surface of your food's packaging or bags. Disinfect them with something like Lysol, or leave them alone for 3 days, since the virus can live on surfaces for 3 days. Don't touch your face while you're handling them to do this, and then wash your hands for 20 seconds afterwards.

These are the facts about the virus, and we can use them to stay calm and safe. It's scary to see how sick COVID-19 makes people, but you don't have to be afraid if you're being careful and you know how it can spread."

RT @oystergirl3: @FollowQanon @anonforq Coronavirus has been around for a long time. Look at the side of your Lysol spray it says it kills the virus.

RT @Carolbiskner1: Nothing like having a pipe break under your bathroom and flooding it and the basement. The worst part is having a stranger come in here with the #COVID19 pandemic and having no lysol to spray in the air. With the babys kidney disease and my #cancer we can't get it. #scaryshit
New Yorker here. They're advising that anyone who leaves New York should self quarantine for 14 days when they arrive in their new location (parents house, upstate, whatever). So the three of you - roommate, sibling, and you - should all quarantine together. That's what my family is doing. Also, lots of Lysol in common spaces.

Does Lysol Kill the Coronavirus? #SmartNews https://www.myrecipes.com/news/does-lysol-kill-coronavirus
Source: Florida Politics â€œTrader Joe's has a message for [responsible adults]: If you bought a bunch of supplies in bulk, you're stuck with them. According to a post from TMZ, at least one location is dropping its otherwise lenient return policy when it comes to those who [stocked up on] supplies amid the COVID-19 virus outbreak. The outlet spotted a sign at a Southern California location announcing the change. â€˜Due to the current circumstances we are unable to accept returns on overbought [sic] products. Thank you,' the sign reads. Typically, the company is more than willing to refund previously purchased items. â€¦ The move comes after Costco made a similar call last week. The company posted a message noting it would reject returns of toilet paper, paper towels, sanitizing wipes, water, rice or Lysol.â€ (04/01/20) https://floridapolitics.com/archives/326210-trader-joes-no-returns-customers-hoarded

Mar 30, 2020 13:42:51 GMT -5 @altakruri said: Mar 29, 2020 11:37:56 GMT -5 @zarahan said:Lysol Disinfectant Spray has had coronavirus on it's label for years already. It works on soft surfaces so spraying a used respirator kills trapped virus. Health workers used to throwing away masks after one use now being asked to keep using the same old respirator by employers should be interested in that. Wait a minute. You mean they can spray a used mask with Lysol, let it dry then reuse? This is just my reasoning. I'm putting it out for, is if any are reading this to fly it among co-workers and evaluate. Heed advise of professional officials. But I mean what's disinfectant do? The can warns to keep Lysol away from eyes. If one uses Lysol, not even as an air freshener, it gets in the lungs right? Lysol kills virus. Know a virus loves lungs and on Lysol's list Health workers sweat. Wear the respirators throughout ther workday. They need new ones after seeing each patient, under extremes no less than 4 a 8hr manday. Again, this is just discussion. Call the CDC or whoever and heed them. Don't come here trying to sue me. Naw no sue. I had the same idea only I was thinking if it was used, they would need something non-toxic, and something that slowed/delayed or killed covid-type particles, or slow ingestion of incoming particles by breaking them up with the agent used to treat mask etc. It would be great if something like that could be found cheap and easy to apply. Homemade masks are a good idea if everyone wore some type of mask. They would not work as well as medical masks but would slow outgoing particles of people coughing/sneezing, thus dampening spread, important for people who may have virus but have not developed substantial symptoms. SOME protection better than none, although I fear some younger black folk I have talked to seem to think that because they feel good and strong, they don't have to worry.

When you buy something through our retail links, we may earn commission and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. As we all weather the unprecedented storm that is the coronavirus, we have a lot of questions about how we should or shouldn't be conducting ourselves. Of course, we all know about proper handwashing techniques and the importance of social distancing, but how do we ensure that our clothes are properly taken care of? How do you disinfect your clothing of the coronavirus? E ven though we're all working from home we still have to put on clothes to walk outside to either exercise or get groceries. And with that comes the chance of potential exposure to the coronavirus. According to a report from NPR, there hasn't been dedicated research about the impact of the virus on clothing. However, it has been proven that COVID-19 can linger on cardboard boxes for up to 24 hours after contamination. Cardboard and cotton are both porous materials, so there's a not-insignificant chance the virus could also sit on your clothing for the same amount of time. However, that porousness is also beneficial, as it actually helps to trap the virus and keep it from going elsewhere. So how do you sanitize clothing after potential exposure to the coronavirus? Per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there's a very simple way to sanitize your clothing: wash them and wash them well. Sending your clothing through a normal wash, complete with detergent, will get rid of the virus if it is indeed attached. In fact, the CDC website says that it's perfectly safe to wash an infected person's clothes with your own laundry. That means there's no need to over wash your clothes; rather, just wash them if you've been out and about or were around someone that didn't practice social distancing well. However, if you're dealing with someone who already has COVID-19 or who thinks they may have the virus, the CDC does recommend wearing protective gloves when handling that person's dirty laundry. Additionally, if you're going to a dedicated laundromat, be sure to also wear latex gloves if you can find some. And, as always, wash your hands! There are products specifically designed to sanitize your clothing. Unfortunately, the most popular laundry sanitizer from Lysol has been intermittently sold out for weeks, and it's increasingly hard to find. If you want to disinfect clothing, your regular laundry habits should do the trick. That being said, here are some good product recommendations to ensure your washing experience during this time goes as smoothly as possible.

Our local Publix grocery stores have set aside 7:00AM to 9:00AM, twice a week for disabled and elderly (geezer) customers. Since DW and I fit into those categories, we went grocery shopping at 7:oo yesterday morning. A Publix team sanitizes the regular and electric carts as they are returned to the area where they are kept. They use the Lysol sprays and wipes. There weren't very many shoppers at that hour, so we were able to find a well stocked store. We got bread, bagels, English muffins, ham steaks, milk, lots of canned goods, hand sanitizer and way too many cookies. And a cake. And some ice cream. DW even got me some almond M&M's. YAY! Most of the people in the store were wearing gloves and masks. It seems that most people around here are taking COVID-19 very seriously. Even the gas stations have gloves available. Yesterday was our first day out in almost two weeks and, since we now have everything we need w e will be able to stay home for several weeks if necessary. I just wish our state (Florida) would mandate "stay at home" for everyone. I hope all of you are healthy and staying safe.
RT @trisnoya: Living in China, how did I avoid getting coronavirus without using Lysol, gloves or hand sanitizers? â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ I stayed home. I washed my hands with soap and water when I did go out (to the supermarket) I did not keep a house party. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
WHY ARE WE OUT GOING TO MULTIPLE STORES? oh because a week ago we got a four pack of tissue after trying to find any for multiple days..... now out of hand sanitizer and eggs, but it would take 20 store trips to probably find any...... and lysol aerosol that was always on hand in my house has not been seen in about a month...this is why we cannot lock down properly and our death rates will go up. now I am getting to the point of asking if it is even worth the risk of seeing others in the stores to try to go get hand sanitizer or tissue.

MelÃ©ndez wrote her landlord a letter asking if there would be a grace period for April rent in light of the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing state-mandated PAUSE restrictions. â€œI'm still waiting to hear back,â€ she said. It just isn't enough. A 90-day moratorium on tenant evictions has been implemented by Governor Andrew Cuomo â€“ but it's not enough, say MelÃ©ndez and other city tenants. With rent bills for April now due, advocates are stepping up their calls for a rent freeze to help those in financial distress due to the coronavirus outbreak. In addition to the eviction moratorium, Cuomo has urged lenders to suspend foreclosures and mortgage payments. But many New Yorkers are calling specifically for a cancellation of rent payments for the foreseeable future, due to the high number of people currently unemployed due to the pandemic. MelÃ©ndez expressed concern about what will happen when the moratorium runs out, noting that tenants will still be on the hook for back rent. â€œThis is a dream for landlords,â€ she remarked. â€œWhen this moratorium is up, you have rent for three months that will be due. This could be a chance to expel low-income tenants and elderly people.â€ A driver for Uber, MelÃ©ndez said she has not been working because she feels her job puts her at high risk of contracting the coronavirus. â€œI thought, what am I doing with a can of Lysol and a mask? I can't socially distance in my car,â€ she remarked. â€œEveryone should be home right now.â€ Juan NÃºÃ±ez, tenant organizer with Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, argued that the moratorium does not provide enough relief to impacted residents. â€œThe eviction moratorium is a start, but what it doesn't address is what happens after it's over,â€ he said. â€œA lot of people aren't able to work because they're laid off. Even if they're working, it might not be the same number of hours or same pay they're used to,â€ he added. â€œAny money they have might be going to food or medicine. They just aren't going to be able to pay their rent after 90 days because they're just not earning.â€ A coalition of advocacy groups has created an online petition requesting that Cuomo and the state legislature enact an immediate suspension of rent, mortgage, and utility payments. The petition had garnered more than 81,000 signatures as of March 31. â€œWorking people across New York State are facing layoffs and struggling to pay rent and buy basic necessities. This problem will not disappear once the threat of COVID-19 has passed, and the eviction moratorium is lifted. Forgiving rent and mortgage debt accumulated during this period will help keep New Yorkers in their homes and stabilize our economy and our state,â€ the petition reads. On March 27th, Mayor Bill de Blasio stated he was in favor of a rent freeze, applicable to rent-stabilized apartments, which would require state action. MelÃ©ndez said she is concerned about paying her bills in the near future, as her husband was recently laid off from his job at a restaurant. Yet, she stressed that others are in even more precarious financial situations. A tenant leader in her building, MelÃ©ndez said that several of her neighbors are undocumented and do not qualify for federal stimulus checks of up to $1,200 that were recently announced by the federal government. â€œThey're not eligible for the relief package, not eligible for unemployment,â€ she said. â€œThey're living in the shadows, and these are the people that are most vulnerable.â€ NÃºÃ±ez, who serves as Tenant Association President in his apartment building, recently lost his job due to coronavirus slowdowns. He said that some tenants in his building are planning to attach a letter to their April rent stub, explaining to the landlord that they are unable to pay rent for this month. For now, NÃºÃ±ez has been stressing to tenants that they cannot be evicted from their apartments during this time.

people wanting to quarantine can't- we gotta go to four or five store at opening each morning to try to find tissue or lysol or bleach.... did this for a week and gave up....eventually found a dollar tree with a limit of one four pack of tissue per person.... meaning we all have to shop more now than before. it IS crazy and dollars over lives

So Lysol is suppose to clean 99.9% of the germs so everyone buys up all the Lysol and use it throughout the house however it has coronavirus in it New York states that people are walking around showing NO SIGNS and they are the deadly type of people ðŸ¤” I don't know about u but..
My roommate keeps â€˜disinfecting' the â€˜things we touch most' which is twofold pointless bc only our other roommate leaves the house and she fully cleans off before reentering the public space but also bc Lysol wipes aren't disinfectant enough to defeat the coronavirus anyway. Smdh

or same process, but use the quatenary sanitizer like lysol wipes. You can buy the mix in gallon jugs from hardware stores.
You clearly have your head up your own ass. I'm from Canada, where this shit was illegal before the pandemic. The people with toilet paper and Lysol and shit is different from fucking medical PPE. I hope to God nobody you know gets this horrible illness because people like this will make it hard for them to receive proper care, and put healthcare workers at risk.

I'm in NY in the middle of the Coronavirus breeding ground, and I've been wearing a mask and gloves since February. I am surrounded by it. Its literally everywhere where I am. If you protect yourself and use your head, you should be ok. If you don't have a mask, make one. Whatever you can wrap around your nose and mouth, do it. You have a better chance of keeping the virus away from your mouth and nose with your face being covered than not covering it at all. If you wear contacts, take them out and wear glasses instead. Its good to protect your eyes as well. Go out and buy a few boxes of gloves now before people start stockpiling them. They are great to have.... especially when it so hard to find hand sanitizer. Buy alcohol now. Once people start buying it all, you won't be able to find it again. Fill a spray bottle with the alcohol and carry it around with you. Leave lysol, lysol wipes, and alcohol spray bottle in your car..... disinfect everything you buy from the store. Disinfect your mail, your packages, the bottoms of your shoes, and doorknobs. Make sure you wear gloves when pumping gas..... let them pump for you if possible. Try to use your credit card rather than cash....its better not to handle money.... it carries the virus. If you buy coffee.... spray or wipe down the cup. Stay away from crowds. Take higher doses of Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K for your immune system. STAY HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE UNTIL THIS SLOWS DOWN. This is what I've been doing on the front lines and although its scary, I've been ok so far. I really wish more people took it seriously. Always remember this, you are aware of what's going on. You are even a little afraid. That alone will put you in survival mode, and you have more of a chance of staying healthy than the ones out there who don't care. Protect yourself and your family and spread whatever knowledge you have with others. The more people who protect themselves, the faster we all get our lives back. Stay safe, and God bless!!!

I actually saw some sanitizers in Amazon but they're only allowing hospitals and government organizations dealing with COVID-19 to purchase it. RT @JaDinePhilly: So toilet paper is slowly coming back in stores. Hand sanitizers, alcohols, disinfectant wipes & Lysol sprays are still nowhere to be found and it's been 3 weeks. CLeah MapusongUsapan #OTWOLBigHeart2020
In case you're wondering if what little stockpile you have left is viable to disinfect against Coronavirus (like me, as I eye the three clorox wipes, can of lysol, spray bottle of clorox kitchen cleanser and bottle of hydrogen peroxide in my crib) https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2
"Jeez, look at table 4 of the Health Care rule.  You'll see that alcohol (in this paper only isopropyl alcohol) and iodine are the only ""Safe"" ingredients, meaning known to kill viruses and bacteria.  

Lysol will kill everything, and contains ethanol (good for bacteria), but also contains a form of alkyl benzyl amonia.  That kills pretty much everything. 

Look, do some research.  A lot of studies are happening right now, and info may change.  The best thing to do for your hands is soap, hot water, and a 20 second or longer scrub.  Clean surfaces with lysol or bleach.  And take marketing from companies with a grain of salt.  EPA seems to like Purrel, and has just put them on their ""safe"" list, but the  FDA so far does not because they haven't proven effectiveness well enough.

Edit:  I did finally find a study from a few years back that takes into account enveloped, non-enveloped, entero, and other viruses vs. ethanol in hand sanitizer.  In this study, ethanol did very well against enveloped viruses, coronavirus included.  Not well at all against others, but right now that not what we're worried about.  The last I saw from a few days ago, the FDA is still wanting better information.

"You still haven't shown that isopropyl is more effective against viruses than ethyl. 

There are types of viruses for which alcohol isn't very effective, but that includes isoproply, as well. Both types should be just as effective against the same types of viruses, and ***BOTH ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST THE CURRENT CORONA VIRUS***.

Really? I think it is justice served because I belong to a lot of reseller groups who thought they were brilliant for buying up every mask in every store in a 50 mile radius of them, then laughing about it because they were so damn smart. That was back about the time covid 19 hit the states. They were told not to do it, but they just patted themselves on the back and proceeded to buy up all the hand sanitizer and lysol wipes. Then they got all but hurt when Amazon and eBay stopped letting them sell it for $20 a mask or $70 a bottle for hand sanitizer. Then it blew up here in the states and hospitals started running out of masks. Then they passed laws banning price gouging, now they are taking it by force. I have no pity for them. They had best hope there are still nurses and doctors left alive when they need to be put on a ventilator.

Ian Johnson thank you Ian for your reply. I'm not making any scientific or medical claims. When the back of the Lysol can says "...kills Coronavirus..." It's referring to the common human Coronavirus and not what we are dealing with now, right? There are several groups of coronaviruses from what I remember. How many are tansmittable from human to human like COVID is? At some point the common human one found it's way in and it's a coronavirus. Sorry for my naivete.
Without sanitizing Covid19 could live on a surface for over a week (depending on a few variables) there by infecting every single person who might touch that spot. After 3 weeks of being unable to buy Clorox/Lysol sanitizing wipes or spray it's a tad frustrating.

"We're being told to move out by the 14th because Governor Murphy ordered Rutgers to clear out its dorms to be used as makeshift hospital/quarantining sites.

I moved out on Saturday wearing a surgical mask, vinyl gloves, and lab goggles to minimize the risk of catching the virus. Bring lysol wipes when you go to move out so you can sanitize things before touching them. Also, letting your stuff sit outside for a week before bringing it into your house would be a good idea."

There is a shortage. People came in and bought as many boxes of whatever masks they could possibly fit in a cart. Even useless dust masks. Any time we got any masks in the night before, people waiting at the doors 6am would rush in right to the masks and clear them out. Same thing with hand sanitizer, lysol wipes, disinfectants, soaps, toilet paper, and paper towels. They need to donate whatever the stores would get because idiots hoard them. N95 masks DO work. What most people seem to be missing when claiming they don't work, is that Covid-19 is NOT airborne. It's passed through close contact, coughing and sneezing. It does protect against water molecules that may contain the virus from being inhaled. Healthcare workers are taking this seriously, so they will be replacing gloves, washing their hands, and discarding masks as appropriate instead of the fuckwits walking around grocery stores wearing surgical masks while their 4 year old walks around touching everything and shoving their fingers in their mouth. Not an exaggeration, I saw this happen. Kids are stupid. Parents are just as dumb.

I have been watching closely Wuhan on YouTube since Mid January 2020. The corona 19 was born Mid December one month before Highly contagious and it will spread rapidly originally I thought social distancing, but better yet full quarantine is our best attempt at slowing this down and saving ourselves. Hospitals doctors, nurses, first responders can't jeopardize them and their families! We need to be responsible for ourselves! We need to take care as best as we can, stock up, stay clean, hygiene! Listerine mouthwash! washing things, beds and when you do white wash add bleach. I also have a spray bottle with water bleach and a disinfectant, like Mr Clean. I also think it's how much we inhale so if we keep our beds fresh and limit what we take in will help us stay healthy. Clean light switches, hair brushes, remote controls anything you touch! I use alcohol infused baby wipes in the car to wipe down key pads and gas pumps as well Lysol spay your shoes before you get back in the car. Change air duct filters at home It's not surviving the virus, it's surviving the lung disease Don't go to hospital or doctors offices!Unless you want to really catch it! There will be no doctors or nurses, no supplies! They will take you out of circulation, I recommended to self quarantine in the comfort of your own home and I would start now! Lead people away from hospitals set up infectious disease facilities I really don't want to tell you the next step!!! So try hard to take care of yourself! Stay Home ðŸ¡ Stay alive! â˜®ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ™ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
Ok back to the virus... A good friend of mine whos daughter graduated HS with my son is now a psychologist. She has been living and working in the city. Not sure what hospital. But she is now re purposed into the ICU. Her crew is flipping critical patients. It seems they need to be rotated regularly or they will drown. She has reported back that they were given one set of PPE. And told to disinfect them. But not given any dependable way to do so. They were face timing and my friend said she had to move away from the camera because she was crying as she listened to her daughter describe the reality there. And to see the fear in her eyes. They were telling her to quit and just come home. There is no availability of disinfectant wipes sprays or even Purell. I was able to get one 4 pack of Lysol at Costco to give her to send her daughter. She shares an apartment with 2 other girls who are working from home. They are bitching at er that they want her not to come home... It is true they have brought in refer trailers to stage the bodies because the morgue cannot handle the volume. Today some figures had 18% of Police, Fire and EMS out sick. The curve has just started to go vertical in NYC. They have at least 2 weeks of increasing fatalities. I have no doubt this is bad sht brothers. Luckily some areas will be mostly spared. The town I work in has 1600 residents. They had their first confirmed case yesterday. They have one small grocery store which has been packed for weeks every day... I used to get lunch there but stopped about 3 weeks ago as this thing developed. Id like to support the local eateries... but Im eating my own food for the duration. Bad enough having to go into the stores to buy it. We are sequestering everything that comes into the house in the garage and giving it a disinfectant wipe before it comes in. Going to the folks to drop of a resupply and pick up a prescription on Friday. Im trying to keep them topped off in case I can no longer go in to their area. I do have Essential ID but its for my county. If they lock down the eastern part of the state I may or may not be able to BS my way in and out. They talked about that a few days ago but decided against it. If things go very south I could see that as a probability. At least at this time everyone is in good health.

Edit: lol it was sarcasm guys! I'm following the comment above. 

Ya'll I have been prepping since mid January.  I have some surgical masks (one box disposable / one reusable), latex gloves, one face shield, one goggle, raincoat, lysol wipes, oximeter, oxygen concentrator machine, and a stocked fridge. 

Most recently I got hands on an individual dosage of hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for one week.  US doctors are behind the eight ball and not prescribing the drugs early enough and at not high enough of a dosage (300mg instead of 600mg by Chinese doctors).

It actually took something like the coronavirus to remind everyone to properly wash their hands (you should wash for 20 seconds in case your wondering). Aside from staying indoors, its one of the best ways to prevent infection. But our hands are not the only things we should keep clean. Our smartphones should be sanitized as well. Why? For one thing, you'd be surprised how many times we actually touch our devices. How many times do we touch our phonesAccording to one study, the average user touches their phones an average of 2,617 times a day. For heavy users (I am assuming this includes tech bloggers like myself, mobile gamers, social media addicts, etc.), the average number balloons to 5,417 times a day. That's about 2.42 hours of screen time for the average user, and 3.75 hours for the heavy user. To put that into perspective, we touch our faces an average of 16 times an hour. Assuming we're awake for 16 hours a day, that's a daily average of 256 times. Also see: Use Google's 3D animals to entertain your kids at home The study adds that the most touched app is Facebook which accounts for 15% of total touches, followed by messaging apps with 11% and the home screen with 9%. For Filipinos, the number could be much higher. We do lead the world on hours spent online (9hrs 45mins) and social media (3hrs 53mins). Let that sink in peeps. How to disinfect your smartphonesExperts say we should clean our phones at least once a day. But how should we clean our devices? Let's start with what you shouldn't use. The general consensus is that you should avoid using cleaning products with harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and pressurized air. So, no to bleach, aerosol sprays, Lysol or Clorox wipes, etc. You shouldn't wash it on the sink as well. Most phones are water resistant (not water proof). You risk damaging your handset and voiding your warranty if you do this. Huawei and Samsung recommend you use 70% isopropyl alcohol. Spray it on a soft lint-free cloth (the type used to clean glasses) and gently wipe over the display once. You can also use alcohol wipes as well. Make sure the phone is unplugged and powered off, and avoid any opening. Air dry before touching. Also see: YouTube limits video quality worldwide to ease Internet congestion For iOS devices, Apple also recommends using 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Don't use anything with bleach. Gently wipe the display. Again, avoid any openings and make sure it is powered off. The backside of the phone can be cleaned using the same material. Remember to avoid excessive wiping as it might cause damage to your device or it could wear out the oleophobic coating (although this interesting video says otherwise). If you have a silicone or plastic case, you should wash it with soap and water. Make sure it is completely dry before putting it on your phone. After your done, properly wash your hands for twenty seconds. Singing the happy birthday song twice helps with the timing.

Do you think it's okay to wash my husband's hospital scrubs in with our other clothes? Or should they be a separate load? Probably a dumb question but I don't know. I use Lysol detergent and I always have for his scrubs.
There are 2 things I have seen circulating... one is a graphic found on webmd which talks about how long the virus lasts on various surfaces, 5 or 6 days for some items and the other is the following which I copy and pasted after a friend posted it - â€œCOVID-19 is very contagious. Many more people have the virus and most of them are asymptomatic. 1) To try to prevent COVID-19 from entering your eyes, nose, mouth- wear glasses and make a mask. A scarf is ok but keep it clean. 2) Prevent Cross Contamination at the Market- -wear a! mask, glasses, gloves, & bring hand sanitizer. -Walk around the market with all on. -After you use your credit card, put it in a small plastic bag.Later, put it back into your wallet only after you clean it. - When you get to your car- put your bags on the ground. Put hand sanitizer on your gloves, rub your gloves together and make sure they are wet BEFORE you touch your keys or touch your door handle. Now open$ your door. Wipe the bag handles down and put the bags on the floor of your car. - reapply hand sanitizer before you close your door. -Close door and get in your car. Remove your gloves and touch your steering wheel. - Once you get Home , bring the bags in and do not put them on the counter. Leave them on the floor. Take each item out and wipe off with a paper towel with soap and water or hand sanitizer on a paper towel or use disinfectant wipes. You can put each item on your counter once it is wiped. So you wipe your box of cereal. Your bag of chips, your yogurt container and etc. - This is similar to what we do to prevent cross contamination between patients. PS- Don't wear your shoes inside. Consider also spraying them with something like Lysol or diluted Bleach- just like you do when you have a puppy and am trying to avoid Parvovirus .â€ Can anyone verify if the info in the graphic is accurate and if the steps advised above are really necessary? Thanks from a concerned Canadian who is trying not yo add to the panic

Yeah, I'm a plumber, and I would love to have some more protection right now. Fortunately, I have a couple of face respirators with great filters, but they are pretty heavy duty, bulky, and hot, therefore they are not at all pleasant to wear for very long. Also, they only really filter what I'm breathing in, but not what I'm breathing out, so if I happen to get it and be asymptomatic, then I can still be breathing out the germs. But I'm stuck like this until production catches up. I am stocked up on gloves, hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, and some full body suits (if it gets to that point).
The other day there was a Fiat driving next to me and my lizard brain said "oh shit that Italian car is going to give me coronavirus." Then I saw that it had a New York license plate and I pulled over and sprayed my entire car with lysol.

"Listen: I know. I've been reading the news, listening to the radio, etc. This is mostly anxiety related and I just wanted some advice in this specific situation.

Since the quarantine first started (we live in Georgia, USA), I've been taking it pretty seriously. I'll admit that at first, I didn't think it was \\*that\\* serious. None of my coworkers did either. But then, I got laid off and I was stuck at home and I found out my nephew (who is 18 and has heart problems as well as asthma) had it. Over time, I began to read more and more about COVID-19 and started to understand that this was not nearly as small a deal as I initially considered it to be.

I started to get really cautious, and I told my mom that we should start stocking up. Then, we began to self-isolate. This is where it gets kind of annoying. My sister wanted to come over and grab something, so we told her to go through the back of the house where we rarely ever go and to try not to touch anything. Her and my little nephew (who is 6) went through the back, and my nephew started to cry because he didn't understand why he couldn't come see us. He kept saying, ""But I'm not sick! I promise!"" and we tried to explain to him why he couldn't come in. Eventually, he calmed down and my mom left him a bowl of ice cream to eat on this counter in the way back of the house and closed the door. They ate ice cream on either sides and talked to each other. 

Well, the next day, my sister doesn't call to check up on my mom like usual. So, my mom, worried, calls my sister and come to find out that my sister was EXTREAMLY offended that we didn't let her into the house, even though my nephew was told he has the virus and had to be quarantined at home. My sister had been exposed to him, as well as her whole family. But none of them, it became clear, had been self-isolating or even kinda quarantining together and had been hanging out with friends, going out and playing around, having pool parties as usual. It started to make me more and more angry because she would constantly make fun of me for taking this seriously. My sister hasn't even really explained this to her kids (the younger ones, who are 6 and 8), and so they get confused and upset every time we drive past their house and they want a hug or to come with us to go to the store and we have to explain every time why they can't. They get upset and say, ""But we aren't sick!"" No matter how many times we explain it, it doesn't help that my sister hasn't sat them down and really shown them the importance of social distancing and why it's not personal. She makes jokes out of it and says it's not serious, so my niece and nephew get confused and ask us why we're taking it so seriously.

She made Lysol jokes and later joked around that she and my niece (15) licked the handles of my mom's car and got mad when we told her that she couldn't come over until the quarantine was over. After my mom invited a bunch of people over (bc she wasn't taking it seriously at first either), I ended up panicking and staying in my room until they left and then disinfecting everything afterward.

I have several reasons for this:

\\-My mom is 54.

\\-She has lung problems.

\\-She doesn't have insurance.

\\-We take groceries to the older people in our neighborhood so they don't have to go out.

My sister told my mom (I could hear her on the phone) that I needed to stop worrying my mom with things she's already worried about anyways and that she's about ready to kick my ass for being so crazy about all this. But I'm literally just following CDC guidelines. I know I'm in the right, but everyone (except my mom) keeps telling me that I'm overreacting and making fun of me and just completely disregarding the situation. Now, my sister and my older niece and nephew are all mad at me and I don't understand why. People are dying, and while my sister and her family have medical coverage, my mom doesn't.

Lastly, here's the biggest reason why this is important to me:

My mom tried to kill herself several years ago, and is still suicidal. I was the one who made her throw up the pills. She was dying on my bedroom floor, and I'm not gonna lie. I'm still traumatized. I was only 17 at the time (I'm 20 now). My mom explained this to my sister, and my sister still said that I was just worrying my mom too much for no reason. But I know my mom, and I've been with her throughout all her depressive episodes since I was a child. I know that her going out or inviting people over isn't her just having fun. It's an unconscious hope that she will catch this virus and die. I explained to my mom that I was just trying to watch out for her because I couldn't watch her almost die again. My mom promised me that she would take this seriously, and told me that she hadn't fully recognized that she really was being reckless. She told me that it wasn't fair to me that she does that and that she's going to try harder not to do it.

I feel like my whole family thinks I'm the enabler with my mom but sometimes, I feel like my brother and I are the only ones who tell her the truth and force her to get help. The rest of my family thinks hiding things from her, avoiding telling her the truth, encouraging her to smoke put (which honestly, is probably the worst thing for her because it makes her anxiety worse---if it actually helped, I'd be all for it!), and telling her to get over it is helping her.

I know that logically speaking I'm in the right. But growing up in such a manipulative and narcissistic family, it's hard for me to stand up for things I believe in because somehow I feel like if I really believe this then I have to be wrong because nobody else around me seems to.

Anyways, am I overreacting? If I am, please be honest."

Librarians across Kansas struggled in March to find a balance between serving the intellectually curious and protecting public health. â€œIn normal situations of â€˜emergency,' I believe public libraries would very much be considered an essential service,â€ State Librarian Eric Norris wrote in an email. â€œOne of the functions would be as a place to bring people together and right now, going to the library is not in the best interest of any community. Closing doors and encouraging people to stay home is.â€ It's a difficult change to come to grips with. The state's public libraries, which now number 325, haven't faced closures this widespread since the 1918 influenza pandemic hit. â€œIt is very much in our DNA to keep the doors open at all costs,â€ Norris said in a previous interview. But as conditions have kept changing and influencing more and more libraries to close, librarians across haven't stopped acting experimentally to find coronavirus-proof ways to keep serving patrons. At the beginning of March, for example, staff members at the Frank Carlson Library in Concordia regularly wiped down tables and required computer users to apply hand sanitizer. (Disclosure: This reporter serves on the library's board of trustees.) Days later, new federal guidelines for social distancing made staffers rethink using the bank of public computers altogether. By March 17, when the American Library Association urged all libraries to close, director Denise de Rochefort-Reynolds was brainstorming ways to avoid shuttering completely, including a no-contact â€œcarryoutâ€ service based out of a sealed entryway. But unknowns persisted. What would materials collection look like? Librarians could wipe down book jackets, but what if a patron sneezed on the pages? By March 18, â€œclosing seemed like the only thing we could do,â€ de Rochefort-Reynolds says. Most libraries plan to stay closed only as long as they have to. In the meantime, they've been grappling with how to shift services online, a task that's crucial following the governor's order forcing most of the state's roughly 500,000 K-12 students to learn from home. Youth services librarians have responded by moving story times online, but copyright protections limit movement into a digital space, where content is often recorded. Publishers such as Penguin Random House have moved quickly to create open licenses that allow librarians to livestream read-alouds on social media, as long as the sessions are not archived. Some patrons, including those with children, rely on libraries for Internet access. De Rochefort-Reynolds says her library removed the Wi-Fi password in case someone wants to sit outside and borrow the signal. But what about residents who want to use a library for the first time? How will a library fill requests for new library cards in cases where a digital process doesn't exist? â€œWe can't solve every problem right away,â€ de Rochefort-Reynolds says. â€œIt's going to be an ongoing process.â€ In places where no COVID-19 cases had been confirmed, a handful of libraries attempted to remain open even as most of their peers had closed. Norma Mullen, director of the Logan Library in Phillips County, kept the doors open and chose to battle COVID-19 with sanitizer on the front counter, a ready supply of Lysol and wipes for returns. But on the day this reporter interviewed her just over a week ago, zero patrons walked through the door. â€œMaybe they're not expecting me to be open,â€ she said. Already, the handwriting was on the wall that closure might be inevitable. Mullen noted how the statewide book courier, an alternative to sending materials to other libraries through the mail, was ceasing deliveries of interlibrary loans, and as the days went by, the library ultimately decided to close. Closing down is a bitter pill to swallow, but librarians planned to keep up the fight to serve. â€œWe are face-to-face people, and we want to put books in people's hands,â€ de Rochefort-Reynolds said. â€œThe transfer of information is what we're all about. But by transferring information, are we transferring virus?â€ For now, she has shifted money for collections into digital resources. Last week, she ordered 45 â€œcozy mysteriesâ€ for the Sunflower eLibrary, a cooperative service to which the Frank Carlson Library belongs. â€œI'm thinking, â€˜What is almost brainless fluff?'â€ she said. â€œThat's something we don't want to lose in the shuffle of this â€” the need to escape.â€ _____ FREE ONLINE RESOURCESThe Kansas State Library has recently aggregated digital resources for educators and families looking to supplement learning at home. Some services, including many e-book lending libraries, require a state library e-Card. â€œRight now we are working out how to get Kansans easier access to an e-Card while still verifying that they are indeed a Kansas resident,â€ state librarian Eric Norris says.

We've had some recent cases of personnel testing positive for the virus here at work, their plan of action to try and maintain good health is having everyone get their temperature checked before they enter the plant and right after lunch. The actual plant checks in the morning with digital thermometer that uses lasers to check you, cool, no contact needed. My company uses one after lunch that they physically rub across your forehead.

This running series of brief dispatches by New York Review writers will document the coronavirus outbreak with regular updates from around the world. â€”The Editors Pandemic Journal #11 and Pandemic Journal #12. RHINEBECK, NEW YORKâ€”After fourteen days of isolation in Brooklyn, I drove with my boyfriend to my parents', upstate. I'm now self-sequestering in my brother's old bedroom, not because I think I'm infected but because my dad is over seventy and it's not worth the risk. This morning, I washed dishes with my mom sitting ten feet away and separated by a high counter. â€œCan I use a dish towel to dry this, or should I use a paper one?â€ I asked her, along with whether I could pet our dog. I wondered whether to wipe down the Lysol wipes container with a wipe I'd pulled out of it. I searched for the spices, normally next to the stove, now moved out of sneezing range. The normal rhythms of drinking coffee and chopping onions and folding clothes are interrupted by second-guessing: If I just washed my hands, but then touched my shirt, should I wash them again before closing the cabinet? Our bodies, I realize, are relearning routines. Easy tasks take close consideration. I've lost my bearings in a kitchen I've known for twenty-six years. A few weeks ago (which feel like years), my boyfriend showed me a video of the British comedian Steve Coogan in his Alan Partridge character, demonstrating how to â€œcomplete an ablution, entry to exit, without using your hands.â€ â€œDrop a thigh,â€ Patridge begins, bending his leg, then â€œelbow down to open,â€ as he clasps his hands and dips his right arm to the phantom door handle. He continues to narrate unusually graceful movements, popping his hip to open the door, spinning on left foot to face the â€œtoilet,â€ lifting its seat with his right one, and so on. â€œIt's funny to imagine getting so good at something so odd,â€ I think of saying, but stop myself from explaining the joke. It does seem impossible to ever adjust to the awkwardness of avoiding stray particles. The routine reminds me of my favorite clip of the choreographer Bill T. Jones performing, initially, a short dance phrase, and then the same phrase while describing each movement in as much detail as possible. What was at first marvelously fluid becomes slower and belabored, though still beautiful, as Jones struggles to account for his body's actions. â€œAs one shifts one's hip onto the left leg, the left arm breaks over the head, the right leg comes in and proceeds up to a passÃ© parallel position,â€ he says, as his typically steady leg wobbles uncharacteristically. The task of carefully thinking about what he's doing appears to unsettle his ability to do it. Last Saturday, day seven of social-distancing, I tried to learn the choreography of Rosas danst Rosas (1983) by Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, whose West Side Story I won't be seeing this spring. Her company made a tutorial available as part of a quarantine-inspired project called â€œDance in Times of Isolation.â€ I'd first seen the piece in a year-long dance workshop in my junior year of college. Last week I watched a dancer teach it as I muddled through on my boyfriend's couch, after finding that the chairâ€”the choreography's one propâ€”kept shifting on his nice wood floors. The dance is full of impulse-like actions and slackened pauses. Sexy movements, like running hands through hair and crossing legs, are done with a staccato precision that nearly de-sexes them. I couldn't learn the steps well or quickly, but I'm hoping by summer it will feel more natural and that the kitchen steps will no longer have to be.

MaxiSunshine, love your user name. This is such a hard time. I have this feeling of impending doom, boiling but held down low anxiety and depression and sadness. I think a lot of us do. I find that a bit of time outside in actual fresh air helps. even if you just sit with a window open if you live in a city and can't get out for a walk. Are you on your own, as in living alone right now? I agree it is hard when you long for something physical like a hug. I'm dealing with some of those family issues of so much togetherness we might explode on each other. lol My peaceful time is in the bathroom. ha. But I can imagine that being on your own is also hard. Thank goodness for face time and skype and zoom, right? Have you ever used any of the apps they make these days like "headspace" or "calm"? I like those. I had a friend send me something that was very thoughtful (after I wiped it down with a lysol wipe, ha ha). She sent me colored pencils and an adult book to use them in. Oh my gosh, it is quite relaxing and soothing. I'm watching funny tv like "tiger king" and being kind to myself. Showering regularly (ha, even more than before this crisis), cleaning up the house, etc. I"m not a project person cranking them out like others I know but I'm trying to work on 'something' every day. It's inevitable that we feel a bit scared and depressed and they are warning the next two weeks will be worse. But the SUN will come out again. It surely will. Hang in there. I"m always here to talk!
Official Government info. vs reality?...COVID ANGERpatient threatens to mash up Couva Hospital; complaints over food, retestingYvonne BaboolalCOVID-19 patients at the Couva Hospital who claim they have been asymptomatic for as many as 12 days and believe they are healthy are threatening to revolt.â€œIt's like we're being held here like prisoners against our will,â€ a patient, who asked for anonymity, told the Express yesterday.He said he was not even sure if his test was mixed up with somebody else's at the Caribbean Public Health Agency (Carpha).He pointed out that according to guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Health, patients who show no symptoms of Â­COVID-19 after seven days are supposed to be tested again.â€œIf I am negative, they are supposed to let me go in the comfort of my home,â€ he said.He said on his floor, there are about 20 people who are showing no symptoms of the virus. â€œNo fever, no coughing, nothing. Some have been asymptomatic seven, ten, 12 days, but they are refusing to test us.â€œI tell them to let me run up and down 20 times so they could see how healthy I am, but they not taking me on,â€ he said.He said at the same time, really sick people are being brought into the same facility, putting their lives at risk.The patient threatened to â€œmash up the placeâ€.â€œIt is total disaster and it go have a revolt in here just now. The army will have to come because it will have bacchanal. A lot of the patients are very angry because they're not getting answers. Every day the criteria changing. I will mash up every blasted thing inside here. I will be like a bull in a China tea shop,â€ he threatened.No answersThe patient said he has already called his lawyer and is at the point where he feels getting arrested for mashing up the place might be his ticket to freedom.â€œIf I do mash up things and they arrest me, at least I will go to court and I will get bail and come out,â€ he said.He said there is no sanitiser in the bathrooms or Lysol, and not even gloves for the healthy patients. The patient said the biggest mistake in his life was when he recently returned from travelling abroad and got a fever and decided to be a model citizen and call the Ministry of Health.â€œThat's like the worst thing I do in my life. I had fever for one day and called the ministry. I got tested and they called be back on the phone and told me I had COVID-19.â€œNo slip, no paper, nothing showing me I was positive. How I sure they didn't mix up my test with somebody else own in Carpha?â€He said the patients' temperaÂ­tures and blood pressure levels are recorded in a journal daily and medical personnel at the hospital know how many patients have been asymptomatic for how long.He said when they ask under what criteria one patient was discharged, they get no answers.â€œWhen you ask the doctors, you get no answer.â€The patient said people who were with him on the same trip â€œare good and about outside Â­normalâ€.Meanwhile, he said patients have to battle with improper and insufficient food and no water to drink. â€œTwo days now patients asking for bottled water to take tablets, and were not given any. Is families have to drop water for us. If the water run out, we have to beg them for some. Inside here is hell.â€Dry breadThe Express also spoke to another Â­patient, who asked to remain anonymous.She said she did a lot of travelling with her family recently, but she was the only one who tested COVID-19-positive.â€œThey are feeling I contracted the virus down here. I was shocked when I was tested positive. Not even my friends who I was in contact with tested positive,â€ she said.She said upon her return home, she went to work as usual and to the grocery, and to MovieTowne once.â€œI had fever, shortness of breath, Â­nausea, loss of appetite and strong lethargy, but no cough. I was shocked when I tested positive. They called and said they were sending an ambulance to take me Couva because Caura was full and couldn't take more,â€ she said.She said she is feeling better and wants to be tested.â€œThe Government is saying after Â­seven days asymptomatic, you are supposed to be tested again but, in here, they keep moving the goalpost. If they do test you, they don't bring back the results,â€ she said.She said they are given food which is not proper for a sick patient. â€œFor breakfast we might get a bread with cheese inside or four slices of dry bread, with one boiled egg.â€œLunch is a big bowl of rice with a little bit of peas and one small piece of chicken and maybe two small pieces of tomatoes and some cabbage.â€œDinner, is more dry bread with cheese paste or shredded chicken or fish. The food comes late, she said.One time, the salad was rotten and she vomited, she said. â€œThe nurse told me I was looking thin and I told her, obviously, I'm not getting enough food.â€She said patients are sustained in Â­between meals with Ensure protein shakes, fruit and Crix crackers sent by relatives.She said patients are not allowed to walk outside their room, adding, â€œThe most walking you may do is from your bed to the window and to the bathroom.â€She said some nurses allow them to walk out into the corridors, but they are not to enter â€œclean areasâ€, which are designated for only health personnel in personal protective equipment.The patient said praying three times a day keeps her sane, while patients also Â­uplift each other.https://trinidadexpress.com/news/local/covid-anger/article_8fb34c9e-73ae-11ea-96e7-83d0c293f666.html

The EPA says to remember that not all cleaning products kill the coronavirus. Soap and water clean germs, but you also must sanitize or disinfect surfaces. Typically, anything with the brand name Clorox or Lysol do the job. Sanitize every high-touch area.

Where the error lies is that you, incorrectly stated that the previous information is not true when, in fact, it is. It's more in how you worded your statement to denounce what was said previously without clarifying that the particular products you use, in your country, state that they disinfect in 30-60 seconds. Many, many disinfecting products do require a longer contact time in order to disinfect to the 99.9% that is stated on the label. We're not just talking Covid-19 here. While there are also products that disinfect in a shorter period of time, again, it depends on the surface you are using it on and what you are trying to kill. For this purpose, we are trying to educate people to read the labels and recognize that, say, simply spraying aerosol Lysol in the air, is not effective or the spray and wipe is not effective. People use these disinfectants for all sorts of stuff and need to know that it depends on what bug they're trying to kill and the surface they're using it on, for the contact time required. The information is also to point out that it's not a spray and wipe process to disinfect or spray the air application. The surface has to be wet and maintain that wetness for the necessary contact time. Disinfection efficacy also takes into account the surface you are using it on. A porous surface is near impossible to disinfect because you can't achieve full saturation for the necessary length of time on each individual product AND all products cannot be used on all surfaces. You are correct in that you should read the instructions on the products you are using to disinfect. Soapy water can work to kill Covid-19, but may also require active scrubbing to disinfect the surface. Again, you mentioned soap destroys the current corona virus, but are vague in the process required. There aren't labels on soap for contact time or processes for how to clean things. I don't like to leave things up for questioning because I think we've all realized how effective many people's hand washing has been in the past. While 70% isopropyl alcohol can work however, it is not effective on a dirty surface. It cannot be used on all surfaces and it cannot effectively kill everything in that case. Isopropyl alcohol cannot kill bacterial spores. Not an issue with a virus, but knowledge to have none the less. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623738/ https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/disinfection-guidelines-H.pdf I have taken infection control classes and had infection control training.

went to a gas station this morning, bought a drink and a biscuit. walking out the door the cashier turned and started hacking into the crook of their arm. immediately threw my food in the trashcan outside and bathed myself in lysol. wouldnt have thought twice about it a month ago, it is allergy season, but now its like that little tinfoil snack could be the death of me. shit sucks.
Yeah my boss was one of them (Iâ€™m in NC) I was forced to come into work on Tuesday with a cough. I tried to tell him I didnâ€™t feel comfortable coming in even though I hadnâ€™t had a fever since Monday morning and my doctor cleared me to work. He told me to come in or not come back. As soon as he saw and heard me coughing he had a fit and sent me home for the rest of the week. He followed me with a can Lysol all the way to the time clock. I guess he took it a little more seriously when it could possibly be in the same room as him.
The cops just needed a fire hose of Lysol to wash them off the streets.

Source: United States House of Representatives â€“ Congressman Jason Smith (8th District of Missouri) WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Congressman Jason Smith (R-MO) introduced the Preventing Pandemic Profiting Act to ensure hard-working families are protected from price gouging of medical and non-medical essentials with the outbreak of coronavirus. Protecting American consumers from price gouging is a focus of President Donald Trump and his administration. During a press conference at the White House on February 26, President Trump said his administration would â€œdefinitely investigateâ€ any reports of price gouging during the coronavirus outbreak. Then, on Monday, Attorney General Bill Barr released a statement underscoring the Department of Justice's commitment to combatting price gouging. He said the department would â€œaggressively prosecuteâ€ anyone who jacks up the price of health care essentials in short supply. This Thursday, to help codify the efforts of President Trump's administration, Congressman Smith introduced the Preventing Pandemic Profiting Act in the U.S. Congress. â€œThis commonsense legislation simply brings federal law into line with responsible laws on the books in Missouri,â€ said Congressman Smith . â€œWhether it is scam phone calls taking advantage of seniors or criminals looking to turn a profit during an emergency, I'm committed to fighting for the safety and security of Missouri families. American companies and immoral individuals should not use a public health emergency as an opportunity to make an extra buckâ€ Specifically, the legislation targets those trying to sell goods and services deemed vital and necessary for the health, safety and welfare of others at an â€œunconscionably excessive priceâ€ during a declared emergency. Those who do, are punishable by up to $1,000 fine, and may also be punished by up to five years in prison. In recent weeks, there have been reports of extreme price gouging on items like hand sanitizer, over the counter medicine, and medical face masks. In fact, weeks after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, some products on Amazon were marked up nearly 50%. A package of Lysol disinfecting wipes, which are usually priced around $13, was priced at over $200. Congressman Smith says the point of this price gouging legislation is to protect the health and safety of all Missourians and prevent businesses and greedy criminals from taking advantage of vulnerable consumers. Congressman Smith introduced this legislation on Thursday, March 12, with Congressman Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey's fifth congressional district.
Source: United States House of Representatives â€“ Congressman Jason Smith (8th District of Missouri) WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Congressman Jason Smith (R-MO) applauded President Trump's decision to sign an executive order on Monday going after individuals intentionally manipulating the supply of vital medical materials and equipmentâ€”such as masks and ventilatorsâ€”in order to turn a profit. Rep. Smith previously introduced the Preventing Pandemic Profiting Act , a bipartisan bill to ensure hard-working families are protected from price gouging during a national emergency. He also stressed that it is important these resources are preserved and made available for rural communities. With this executive order, President Trump directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of individuals who are found trying to turn a profit by controlling these essential medical supplies to manipulate their market value. Congressman Smith fully supports President Trump's decision to issue this executive order, which Smith calls a first step in implementing his bipartisan bill. He is calling on Congress to pass his legislation to not only codify the Trump Administration's efforts, but to give the DOJ a federal charge when prosecuting these criminal actors. â€œI want to thank President Trump, and his administration, for their leadership and commitment to protecting American consumers during this national emergency,â€ said Congressman Smith . â€œUnfortunately, even with President Trump's executive order targeting those trying to turn a profit on these essential supplies, the Department of Justice will have to prosecute these individuals under state laws, and there are currently 14 states that have no laws against price gouging. What we need to do is pass my bipartisan legislation and codify President Trump's efforts, which will give the DOJ the authority to prosecute this abhorrent practice under federal law.â€ Congressman Jason Smith introduced the Preventing Pandemic Profiting Act on Thursday, March 12, with Congressman Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey's fifth congressional district. Specifically, the legislation targets those trying to sell goods and services deemed vital and necessary for the health, safety and welfare of others at an â€œunconscionably excessive priceâ€ during a declared emergency. Those who do, are punishable by up to $1,000 fine, and may also be punished by up to five years in prison. â€œThis commonsense legislation simply brings federal law into line with responsible laws on the books in Missouri and gives President Trump's Administration the tools he needs to fight this practiceâ€ said Congressman Smith. â€œWhether it is scam phone calls taking advantage of seniors or criminals looking to turn a profit during an emergency, I'm committed to fighting for the safety and security of Missouri families.â€ In recent weeks, there have been reports of extreme price gouging on items like hand sanitizer, over the counter medicine, and medical face masks. In fact, weeks after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, some products on Amazon were marked up nearly 50%. A package of Lysol disinfecting wipes, which are usually priced around $13, was priced at over $200. Smith says the point of this price gouging legislation is to protect the health and safety of all Missourians and prevent businesses and greedy criminals from taking advantage of vulnerable consumers.

"Yes. Another dealership down the street was shut down by the health dept because they weren't appropriately enforcing social distancing. If I were staying in the office it wouldn't be so scary, it's having to be the office runner (bank, post office, etc.) that makes me nervous. When I am working in the office, at least I'm in an enclosed glass booth (switchboard).

My complaints may become moot very soon, as I don't expect to be considered essential for much longer. Not many people are buying new cars right now. I think they'll keep the service department and body shop open because they are essential, but I expect they will have to close the sales department soon.

If anyone has an extra can of Lysol, hit me up lol."
Who do we speak with regarding employers of 'essential workers' who are NOT implementing social distancing and are NOT providing any personal protective equipment (sanitizer, masks, lysol spray..)? #COVID19 #EssentialWorkers #PPE #AskMyMayor #gov #govKC

My wife amd I went to a mexican grocery store and it was fully stocked. Even had TP and lysol
Lysol is a joke. Salt, water and vodka kills on contact. It takes 90 minutes for lysol to kill germs.

At least, not the last time I scrolled through the list. Glad I only got 1 tub of them. Not glad that the store had got in Clorox wipes that same day and I picked the Lysol wipes because it was a larger amount. :/

RT @blvnnt__: The Flu is seasonal ....and can also kill you. The flu has several strains ...just like coronavirus (which is why Lysol has it on the list of things it can kill). They put up cameras to watch you without tellin you. They donâ€™t need to kill you for the future unless you in the way RT @RonPonceDeLeon: @why_not_rich They say Coronavirus will be a virus that will come around seasonally my assumption is ... again this is just my assumption that the towers will pump out 5G and kill people which will help with population control while still being able to push mankind further into the future

The back of a can of Lysol says it kills coronavirus. So like the drank fish tank cleaner guy, if I decide to self medicate by spraying copious amounts of Lysol in my mouth and I die, is it Trump's fault or Lysol's?
Disinfecting all the surfaces of your home is more important now than ever. Here are some answers to some of your commonly asked questions https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/23/21188690/coronavirus-cleaning-sanitizing-lysol-clorox-bleach-alcohol
The fucking numbers keep changing every few days which tells me the experts are guessing at this whole thing. And what happens in another 30 days? This virus says "Oh Look..it's May..time to go." Talking TV heads are talking out their asses if they think any of the predictions are rock solid. We need to spray the state with Lysol.

The crazy that this virus is exposing is just as alarming as the virus. COVID19 is about 5G internet and lysol wipes are the source of the virus? People believe this nonsense?

RT @OwenElectric: The EPA says to remember that not all cleaning products kill the coronavirus. Soap and water clean germs, but you also must sanitize or disinfect surfaces. Typically, anything with the brand name Clorox or Lysol do the job. Sanitize every high-touch area.
#Coronavirus Creo que es hora de cambiar mi mensaje al final de algÃºn correo o chat: Abrazo de Lysol.
Live in the us. Our state is a stay at home state. I am considered essential and can stay open. I work on cars. I am in and out of cars all day long there is not enough lysol in the world to make me feel like they are clean. Cars are gross. I have seen sneezes on windshields for years. I'm pretty sure I'm going to close the doors for the rest of april till this blows over maybe longer. It just does not seem worth it to me being open. My wife me or my employee could get sick or die. It's just a hard decision. Any input on what I should do.
Weird, paranoid question but hopefully someone will know the answer. If you spray an aerosol like lysol on a surface, can it kick up coronavirus particles if the wind is blowing. For example, if you are spraying outside and you breath in the wind.

Your dirty hands touched the sanitizer bottle and then you touched your keys etc. The transmission into any airway isnâ€™t likely when itâ€™s on your clothes etc but itâ€™s virtually impossible to prevent transmission of bacteria throughout your home even if you were to strip down and wipe everything down right away, the one thing you touched that didnâ€™t get wiped down will contaminate everything else again. Youâ€™re just trying to mitigate risk. If you get the bacteria on your hands and go home and then sanitize in your kitchen/bathroom, youâ€™re done. You will almost certainly get it. We can only so much...... I see my wife pretty much cleaning the sink, desk and pretty much everything with lysol wipes...... The safest way is to stay home I guess. That Rig Fit sure comes in handy these days.
You all realize this virus has been around since the 80's if I'm not mistaken. Dont believe me look on your lysol wipes for what it kills. We will still be getting stuff from China for the simple fact, most americans do not understand that American labor and American greed triples the costs of everything. The workers get paid maybe a dollar and that's being generous, with no health care or anything. Where anyone working here must make federal minimum wage in manufacturing.
Human Coronavirus is NOT listed on the can of Lysol disinfectant spray.
This strain is not the strain that Lysol can kill FYI there are other strains of corona-virus

Quote: Originally Posted by coschristi It has worked elsewhere. That's why I said that after the antibody tests are available, since we have recovered they might want out blood. Can't have mine; I am too anemic but I'm sure my other family members would be in. The boys I hope. I'm not a fan of females 'of childbearing age' donating out of concern for their own health. Anemia + Colorado's elevation is not a good combination. Donating a pint of blood will not make you anemic. They will not accept a donor whose hemoglobin is not high enough for her to safely donate. Plasma is replaced in about one day, red cells in four to six weeks. Quote: Originally Posted by BrassTacksGal The biggest question, what is your temperature?

After you have the virus you are are likely to be immune, at least for a few months, much like any other coronavirus. No, there is not always a fever with COVID-19. Quote: Originally Posted by Rvguru6338 You are correct, this is why I suggest especially for old people that are relying on grocery delivery that they set the bags in their garage and spray the bags down with Lysol. After that sits for a while then they remove the food and spray the outside of the containers of the food down as best they can. This will put it in perspective for you how contagious and prevalent this virus is. They just recently found out that people can catch it from tracking it in their homes on the bottom of their shoes. From like walking through grocery stores in public places. Yes thatâ€™s correct you can get it on the bottom of your shoes and bring it into your home and there is enough virus present to infect people. From your shoes. Source? If you handle your shoes, wash your hands. Quote: Originally Posted by coschristi I still think it's because of the inflated flu stats. That's what 'the deniers' were saying: "We didn't have to quarantine because of the FLU & the FLU was so much worse! The FLU kills hundreds of thousands every year!" Well, no it didn't. The flu + PNEUMONIA kills hundreds of thousands every year. There are multiple causes of pneumonia. Fungal. Choking on your soup (aspiration) can cause pneumonia. So much FUD (fear, uncertainty & doubt) was promoted every year about the "killer flu" but actions speak louder than words. If the actual flu was anywhere near as foreboding as COVID, we would have had shelter-in-place ordered nationwide every flu season & we never have. You can't really blame the villagers when the CDC Shepard boy has cried "Wolf" every year for over a decade. You need to stop obsessing about flu stats, which have nothing to do with COVID-19. We do not shelter in place for flu because flu cases do not overwhelm hospitals the way COVID-19 is doing.

Can it survive on shoes for days? The assumption is yes. Lots of nasty germs and bacteria can, and do. There is nothing newsworthy about that. Do people normally frequently handle their shoes? I guess that is an individual thing. I sure don't. For the past month, all I have worn is athletic shoes - I rotate about 3 pair or so. Mine stay tied, and I never even touch them, getting them on OR off. They are taken off as soon as I get in the house, and they stay in the same place until I wear them outside again. Common sense goes a long way here.

I stopped wearing my shoes inside the house a few years ago. Picked up this habit while staying with a friend in Moscow. It's dirty and digusting to wear shoes worn outside inside your house

Normally I would also worry about that. I tend to make my own cleaners or only use organic ones. In the day of covid , to be honest I donâ€™t care ! Cleaning my house with the strongest stuff I can find- pinesol Lysol whatever kills bacteria. Anything to keep covid away!
Glad i received them in time to share with my family and my son's family, i use it ecery time, when i come back from groceries shopping by spraying on the bags and wipes on polybags. And spray on the shoes outsole to avoid bring coronavirus into the house. I glad i ordered them.
Right product for disinfecting during this Corona virus pandemic.
Great product and so happy I ordered this before the coronavirus...
Some non perishable grocery items are shown, but as soon as I try to add them to my cart they disappear. Not sure if it's not in stock anywhere, or not shippable in my area. I'm not even requesting 2 day delivery, just adding to cart. ======================================================= Not taking Covid-19 seriously? You're going to hell in a hand-basket.
The Mississippi Department of Healthâ€™s latest figures show Calhoun County with three confirmed cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Dr. Bruce Longest, Chief of Staff at Baptist-Calhoun in Calhoun City and owner of Bruce Family Medical Clinic on the Bruce Square, was one of those cases. â€œI first felt sick on Sunday afternoon, March 15,â€ Dr. Longest said. â€œI was fine when I woke up, but it hit pretty quickly. I checked my temperature and I had fever, which is something I never have. I initially thought I was getting the flu.â€ First thing Monday morning he was tested for both the flu and COVID-19. â€œResults of the flu were back immediately and I knew it wasnâ€™t that. Still, I really didnâ€™t think I had COVID, but some other viral illness. Testing for flu is just a nasal swab, but COVID-19 required a nasal swab and a throat swab. I immediately began my quarantine that Sunday.â€ â€œThe first three days I did not even get out of the bed I felt so bad. My wife (Lori) said she knew I was sick because I did not even turn the TV on for three days. Furthermore, I didnâ€™t eat for three days, which is highly unusual.â€ â€œOnce I got past the first few days I watched TV mainly about the pandemic and I read all I could from Centers for Disease Control and the State Board of Health about the virus. I also read a lot of general medical articles and watched movies.â€ His favorite among all the movies he watched â€“ Sound of Music. â€œItâ€™s a classic,â€ he said. But the isolation did take a toll. â€œThe worst part of being quarantined was just knowing you could not interact with the world. After a few days, I became stir crazy and almost disoriented to what day it was.â€ â€œMy biggest concern when I realized I must quarantine was who was going to take care of my patients. We were facing a crisis and I needed to be there. The thing I missed most throughout was not going to work. I just kept thinking about all the things that needed doing in the office.â€ Prior to being quarantined, Dr. Longest had taken off three days to travel to the SEC Basketball Tournament in Nashville, which was canceled not long after he arrived. Add that to the two weeks of quarantine that followed and itâ€™s the longest heâ€™s been away from work in his career. Throughout the quarantine, Dr. Longestâ€™s wife Lori cared for him while protecting herself at the same time. â€œShe wore a mask and did her best to keep her distance. We have used enough Lysol to last a lifetime and have washed our hands a hundred times a day.â€ Dr. Longest was able to still participate in work, even though he was isolated in his home. â€œI continued to take calls from the hospital and nursing home and give telephone orders,â€ he said. â€œI have been able to keep up with lab and x-ray results on the computer. My office staff has fielded messages and I have called in bunches of prescriptions and given advice.â€ He finally received his COVID-19 test result last Wednesday, March 25 at 4:30 a.m., over a week after he was first tested. â€œMy first reaction when I got the positive result was how blessed I was to have not had a worse case, not having to be in the hospital or on a ventilator,â€ Dr. Longest said. â€œMy biggest take away was realizing that this was indeed going to be a major problem and that it was here in Calhoun County.â€ Because he had self quarantined once detecting the first fever, he was deep into the 14 days of recommended quarantine once the positive test came back. He now has no symptoms and was excited by opportunity to return to work. Dr. Longestâ€™s advice to all is follow all the recommendations promoted the past few weeks. â€œI would stress all the things they are telling you on TV: wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands!â€ he said. â€œStay away from anybody unless it is absolutely necessary, and at the first sign of symptoms, quarantine yourself and seek medical advice. I was extremely lucky to have a great outcome, but the virus is so variable, others wonâ€™t be that lucky.â€

I'm a retired anaesthetic and once ITU physician. I've been trying to follow the literature as I moderate a closed doctors' forum in UK. All this still applies. Since then: There has been no hard evidence of an effective drug regime though chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been widely used and the FDA has approved them. They are not innocuous (up to causing deaths) and the evidence of efficacy is weak. Trials go on. There are good grounds for hope that social isolation at the levels in Italy, Spain and UK is reducing spread. We await the results of slackening in Wuhan. There are first human trials of vaccines but a working product is a good way away if ever. Infection seems to confer useful immunity which probably persists. Virus survival seems to be a few hours on porous materials up to a few days on hard materials. Evidence of transmission by fomites does not exist but it is plainly plausible. Soap and detergents and alcohol 60% are effective. Lysol and Chlorhexidine are not. There is still no hard data about the incidence of asymptomatic infection. 50% seems a reasonable guess at present. My attention has been drawn to trials of masks and handwashing. These were looking at common cold or influenza type illnesses and were not done in the context of social distancing in place. Both show a modest effect, but it was modest. Mortality in patients needing ventilation is high. 50% and above.

@bugcounter The question an informed shopper has isn't about soap and raw fruit and veggies, but whether Lysol kills Covid-19 that may or may not be residing on delivered boxes or bags, which scientists already have determined is possible.
@ButcherNate1 I saw one last night at Kroger's parking lot, my first thought was they are going home to unload all that stuff they bought someone with Corona virus may have touched.... Keep the gloves on until it's all sprayed with lysol

@ComplexSneakers Due to covid-19 all those mags are worth probably four bottles of hand sanitizers, and two bottles of Lysol.

@DavidRadcliff Lol no! I fully support the use of Purell & Lysol rn. I bathe in the stuff. But I didnâ€™t before, because experts said chill. So Iâ€™m just wondering if weâ€™re gonna conquer coronavirus, then have to face Super Coronavirus.
@dbongino This coronavirus thing is starting to sound like a load of BS. People are being misled to believe CV is something new when it's just another of many viruses Lysol kills stated on the back of their cans. #KAG2020
@DiamondandSilk Nancy blew a fart! Break out the lysol! Call in the hazmat teams! lol, I know the feeling, I'm awake worrying about who is next to get sick from the coronavirus, the virus that Donald Trump spoke of in his speech, the one that Pelosi tore up and the Democrats became all giddy.
@DrDenaGrayson can you advise if 70% Isopropyl Alcohol can disinfect for Coronavirus? EPAâ€™s Schedule N list does not list it (Lysol, Bleach & Hydrogen Peroxide,) but CDC recommends for electronics. Boss wants to clean with it & email to CDC not answered, go figure.

@EthanHelhowski w/concerns of COVID-19 we are working w/retailers to ensure our stations are as clean as possible. Stations will be cleaned frequently w/appropriate products. You can also bring a Lysol wipe to use before a session/reduce risk by washing hands often including after your session.
@EvelDick Don't neglect your shoes. The virus can live on shoes for days. We remove them on entering, Lysol them on the tile and don't wear shoes anywhere in the house. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-can-shoes-spread-covid19-soles-clothes-clean-wash-live-surfaces-a9428116.html
@FavGhostwriter They charging as if Lysol kills the Coronavirus, SMH
@giacoknox I do not mean this as a negative comment, but you are somewhat mistaken in your statement about the Lysol spray. Their listing of coronavirus refers to a class of viruses named for their cellular shape. Reading about them will help understand them better. https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses
@GOP @GOPChairwoman You guys have "coronavirus" press conferences. The coronavirus has been around since dirt. Why not have common cold press conferences? Here's a can of Lysol made last year...get your pressers more focused on Novel COVID19 or don't bother asking for donations.
@GovMurphy wht Doctor talk about vs spraying or whipping down whatâ€™s the point of a lysol spray u saying that not effective against the #COVID19. I believe we do like other countries is spraying down the whole country to stop the spread cuz it still in the air.
@GovRonDeSantis Congratulations....Iâ€™m surely positive that your family are safe from COVID 19. However my Mother in Melbourne, FL has autoimmune. She literally has to Lysol & bleach everything and can never leave home. Donâ€™t let my Mom die! #StayHomeSaveLives #FlattenTheCurve
@GretchenInOK Ahhrr...ye can get COVID-19 masks from PIRATE FASHIONS fer $3.00 apiece, Lass...they bee BLACK. Washable, Lysol-able...
@gucci_dolphin No see thats exactly it lol okay so we do agree bro. Cause it is a mutated strain of the original Coronavirus. Some people bro think its legit the same to the point that they shower themselves in Lysol since it says it protects from coronavirus ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£

@palafo @pak38197 I believe this. Prior to COVID-19, when folks at the office spray s**t (no matter the distance) or the cleaning crew comes by, OMG...I can bearly breathe. I use lysol disinfecting wipes, etc. If the droplets are still in the air, seemingly aerosols could spread them around.
@Paul_Imanuelsen @mitchellvii Which coronavirus are people dying immediately from? Most everyone has some form of CV virus in their system which have been around since dirt. Look at the back of this older Lysol can.
@PeterMerlinCane Where are the employers? Why aren't they providing gloves, masks, lysol? Can they get more room in their "dorms?" As they go across America, do we know how long does COVID-19 stay alive on fruits and vegetables?
@politico Why is it after weeks and months of warning essentials like lysol that kills coronavirus cant be found i believe more and more this is a contribed population control virus and they want people exposed in trucking we can find wipes, lysol anywhere

@Retrospective_1 @iWorkTheHardest But pair that with a common coronavirus that was pre-existing and could be disinfected with Lysol and.... your body would be too weak against it if you have already have health issues. Iâ€™m just free styling bro Iâ€™m not a doctor.
@rk_p I donâ€™t have a home gym. But my Personal Trainer sprayed her doorway pull-up bar with Lysol and left it on her front porch for me to pick up and bring home to use. So every day I do pull ups, push-ups, and sit ups to try to stay in shape and not gain the #COVID19 15.
@Russianvids The thing about its, Coronavirus is listed as one viruses that a can of Lysol can kill. And Coronvirus is also listed as another form of the common cold or a version of the flu. So it might be a real virus, but it's definitely not what the media is making it out to be.
@scotthelsinger Literally had the â€œred spread â€œ thought yesterday after going to the grocery store and carrying my own Lysol and wipes. I wish COVID-19 would color itself like that stuff you rinse your mouth with that shows plaque.
@seanmdav @josephlentz300 And that number is cooked. Corona virus tests are not COVID-19 specific. Lysol cans have advertised efficacy against Corona Virus's for years. Millions of Americans carry it.

[QUOTE="Dr. M, post: 1608374, member: 169169"] Tips for disinfecting interior and exterior? I have chatted with Honda and they have no recommendations. Searching online I have found definitely do not use bleach, but see mixed questions on alcohol. Any suggestions how to disinfect steering wheel, starter button, gear shift knob, and interior and exterior door handles (painted and chrome)? [/QUOTE] Thank you for posting this! I have been wondering the same for nearly a month now. Had a 'to do' on my list to check with Honda but sounds like it's not worth the call now. What a huge disappointment though. You'd think Honda would have anticipated these questions. So what I've been doing is wearing gloves, etc., but also wiping down steering wheel, dashboards, knobs, shifter and my seat with a lysol/water mix and then rinsing and drying. I dread thinking about what this will do over the long run. But I guess that will be a 'first world problem' in the long run. When I get groceries at a curbside pick up, I raise the hatchback of my CR-V and have the store employee put groceries in back of car (or trunk) and then after I 'clean' all those packages in my garage, I wipe down the weather guard floor liner. Honestly, grocery shopping is exhausting anymore! and is a disincentive to leave the house! So there's that! But since there are still a few 'unknowns', I guess it is worth it. If somebody learns anything better, I'm all ears!

A food microbiogist named Angela annandappa recently did iama, and basically said this video is not correct...here is her answer Angela_Anandappa :verified: Verified3d I disagree with many of the principles that he builds his video upon as they are misguided. Many other food safety experts who are in the field and are microbiologists who understand food on a deep level also disagree with much in the video. It is very unfortunate that his video was shared so many times spreading misinformation. I wrote this article addressing a few things in the video and hope you would read it. I've also pasted this into another comment. 1) Virology 101 â€“ Viruses are neither dead nor alive. We consider them alive when they are active and reproducing and non-living at other times. They are made of DNA or RNA (SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus) surrounded by a protein sheath. They NEED a living cell to reproduce. That means that, without appropriate living cells to hijack, they cannot replicate when sitting on a counter. Or cardboard. Or steel. Or plastic. Or really any other surface that isnâ€™t alive, for that matter. We know for sure that this virus is a human coronavirus, and we have no evidence for other hosts, so unless the virus is in a human, or in human cells we can be pretty confident it isnâ€™t reproducing. 2) You may have heard that the virus can survive in aerosols for 3 hours and on some surfaces, for up to 10-17 days. If it is aerosolized, like it would be in a sneeze, the droplets can be inhaled and you can get sick. However, there is currently no evidence that any viral particles found on surfaces have caused illness through skin contact alone. This means you canâ€™t get sick just from touching an object, and that you need to transfer the viral particles into an entry point in your body. This is why the CDC recommends that you donâ€™t touch your face, your nose or eyes and that you must wash hands diligently and thoroughly. These are entry points areas that easily pick up and transfer viruses into your mucosal membranes. So, picking your nose, rubbing your eyes, licking your fingers are not advised. 3) Plan your shopping trip and get everything you need from the fewest number of stores as possible. Use a disinfecting wipe or spray sanitizer on the cart and wipe down all the parts you will touch. If you touch parts that are not properly disinfected, any viral particles that could be there from a previous customer have can be transferred to your hands. 4) Purchase fresh produce, frozen fruits, veggies, and anything that you can prep, store, and freeze quickly for later use. Frozen produce is a healthy option to extend the time between shopping trips. There is no known 5) Purchase fresh produce, frozen fruits, veggie, and anything that you can prep, store, and freeze quickly. Frozen produce is a healthy option to extend the time between shopping trips. 6) Put away food in the proper storage conditions promptly. i) Hot items should be kept hot, quickly consumed, and leftovers put away quickly. ii) Cold items should be promptly placed in the refrigerator or freezer, as appropriate. iii) Sealed items that are stored at room temperature should be stored in a pantry where temperature does not dramatically fluctuate; do not leave them in the car or garage. 7) If you wish to disinfect the surface of any items you purchase, be sure to use an appropriate method. Hereâ€™s where following instructions is critical; if you donâ€™t, you are pouring chemicals into the water system, wasting money and products, and not actually disinfecting anything. As a matter of protocol cleaning comes first followed by disinfecting. To clean, you can use an all-purpose chemical cleaner OR detergent and water with a clean cloth or paper towel. Cleaning includes scrubbing with detergent (soap) and making sure all the detergent is rinsed off completely with clean water. Simple: yes. Effective: also yes. Kitchen counters, cabinets and all other surfaces in the kitchen should be cleaned as usual and no additional step are necessary if you feel confident youâ€™ve done a good job of cleaning. Disinfection requires a chemical to disinfectant and remove any remaining pathogens (if any) and virus particles. Again, if you cleaned well, you really do not need to use this step. Itâ€™s an additional precaution. To use a sanitizer or disinfectant, you must follow all the manufacturerâ€™s directions. For example, Lysol must be sprayed on the entire surface and allowed to remain on the surface for 3 minutes. Ideally, allow it 10 minutes to dry. For the novel coronavirus, use any disinfectant from this CDC recommended EPA approved list. https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2 8) Fresh produce should not be washed with soap. Any fresh produce you purchase should be washed (do not soak) in a bowl of warm water (use a produce brush to scrub the surface) and then rinse with warm running water. If you live in a part of the country with no city water supply, you could prepare a 100ppm chlorine rinse for fruits. Fruits with a harder skin (eg: oranges, watermelons) may withstand more rigorous scrubbing and a hot water rinse for added safety. 9) Fresh produce should never ever be directly placed in a sink. No matter how well you believe you clean, sinks and refrigerators are some of the dirtiest places in a home. Studies have shown sinks harbor Salmonella, E.coli, other pathogenic bacteria, and viruses. Sink cleanliness has less to do with the appearance of cleanliness and more to do with the construction of the sink, joints, caulk points, and the stainless steel being beaten up over time and creating microscopic crevices where bacteria find harbor. 10) Proper handwashing for 20 seconds includes scrubbing between fingers, under and around nails, and on the back of the hands, which is incredibly important. If you wish to use a hand sanitizer, apply it thoroughly, cover all the surfaces, and allow to dry. Do not wipe. Many Coronavirus patients experience digestive discomfort and diarrhea and shed the virus in their stool. This makes handwashing for patients and healthy people critical for preventing the spread. Watch out for people who arenâ€™t washing their hands! Make sure weâ€™re all being sanitary (just in general a good thing). 11) I also recommend washing your face, hands, and any parts of the arm exposed while you were out shopping. Wash with soap and water. Handwashing is the barrier between every step of transporting the virus from one place to another. 12) Do not take food out of its original packaging until you are ready to use it or have a need to store in a different container. Original packaging preserves the food for the longest duration and provides you another way to extend the time between shopping events. 13) Work with the assumption that it is your hands that transport viral particles to your face, nose and mouth. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling all items coming from the grocery store, put them in their appropirate storage places, and then wash your hands again. When itâ€™s time to use these items retrieve them, open the packages and place the items into serving containers using a clean hand. Then wash hands again before consuming or preparing food. 14) Lastly, it is important to note that the food industry is taking every precaution to ensure food is produced in a safe manner and ingredients, food product and packaging are not contributing to the transfer of foodborne illness. Experts in experts in chemistry, microbiology, toxicology, engineering, and the science of food work to implement science-based protocols tp protect the food supply and workers. With respect to grocery shopping protocols are in place by grocery stores to reduce traffic and disinfect surface that could be touched by customers. The most important method of transmitting a virus like SARS-CoV-2 is by touching it and then transferring to a mucous membrane, and this is most effectively controlled by good hygienic practices. Thorough handwashing can do more for preventing SARS-CoV-2 than disinfecting our environment, social isolation alone. Additional articles and perspectives have been offered by respected colleagues and food safety experts and linked below for reference. https://www-prevention-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/amp31955373/how-to-clean-groceries-coronavirus/https://mobile.twitter.com/bugcounter/status/1243319180851580929

Since then: There has been no hard evidence of an effective drug regime though chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been widely used and the FDA has approved them. They are not innocuous (up to causing deaths) and the evidence of efficacy is weak. Trials go on. There are good grounds for hope that social isolation at the levels in Italy, Spain and UK is reducing spread. We await the results of slackening in Wuhan. There are first human trials of vaccines but a working product is a good way away if ever. Infection seems to confer useful immunity which probably persists. Virus survival seems to be a few hours on porous materials up to a few days on hard materials. Evidence of transmission by fomites does not exist but it is plainly plausible. Soap and detergents and alcohol 60% are effective. Lysol and Chlorhexidine are not. There is still no hard data about the incidence of asymptomatic infection. 50% seems a reasonable guess at present. My attention has been drawn to trials of masks and handwashing. These were looking at common cold or influenza type illnesses and were not done in the context of social distancing in place. Both show a modest effect, but it was modest. Mortality in patients needing ventilation is high. 50% and above. Thanks for this. Number 4 looks like the best news of all, if that is the case. In any case, thank you.

Again I ask, why? I think itâ€™s obvious this isnâ€™t just for a coronavirus strain of the flu that has yet to even reach the stats of the seasonal flu. Coronavirus isnâ€™t new (thereâ€™s a reason itâ€™s listed on a Lysol can)...
"Also https://www.thecloroxcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Original-Pine-Sol-Multi-Surface-Cleaner.pdf

and the actual product page: 
https://www.pinesol.com/products/original-pine-cleaner/


So they list the original Pine-Sol as a disinfectant (when used full strength, and takes 10 minutes.)

NOTE! This seems to not be true for the Lemon Fresh version.  Don't make the same mistake I did. I now have like 4 gallons of ineffective product. My fault for not reading up first when I saw it in-stock."
Also, what's the situation on TP, Lysol wipes, 70% iso, and disinfectant sprays in Toronto? Are those still available in stores (shoppers? Grocery stores?) Iâ€™m currently abroad and all of those things are still emptied out at any stores I can get to
Am I crazy for not spraying my kids and myself down with Lysol, stripping off our clothes & throwing in the washer immediately when we come home? Not leaving my groceries in the garage or wiping them down with disinfectant wipes? NO. I AM RATIONAL. Germaphobes = NUTS #COVID19
Am I the only one that sprays my packages down with Lysol? #coronavirus #quarantinethoughts #CoronavirusPandemic
And also the fact that the virus doesnâ€™t live forever. It has a shelf life - this isnâ€™t radiation. If someone wants to rent me their place on the beach for a 1/4 of the price, Iâ€™ll happily wipe it down with some Lysol wipes and enjoy myself.
And its not just the Poconos. Until recently an Airbnb ad for a Fishtown two-bedroom advertised it as a "CORONAVIRUS FREE ZONE." One of pictures was a bunch of toilet paper rolls, paper towels, and various Lysol products. (It was rewritten after I contacted the manager)
And you are saying it is putting sneak upon sneak... Canadians are hurting more than at any time in recent history and Justin Trudeau will simply put another hit on them thinking he can sneak it by.

Are none of you going to the grocery store or hardware store or grabbing your mail from your mailbox?? I'm not doubting that some of you have months of food saved up but getting away from everyone puts less lives at risk than staying home. If you get your mail six times this week you have possibly spread the disease to at least your entire neighborhood 6 times this week because of cross contamination. If you go fuel up with gloves on and then go out to the middle of nowhere for the entire week you have only maybe cross contaminated once. Hell my local gas station has a guy out there in a full face respirator and two cans of Lysol spraying down and wiping down each pump after it's used. I know this because my work is essential and I had to get gas. Until all essentials are locked in their homes or everyone gets it there is no stopping this thing because all essentials are cross contaminating to everywhere.
As a father of two mixed Asian girls, this disgusts me. We have to do better. Also, if you are going to spray Lysol, do so in your own direction given that the US has the most cases in the world now. RT @HopClear: Utah Asians feeling that racism "two Chinese students were sprayed with Lysol at a Cedar City Walmart and told to â€˜go home." https://www.abc4.com/news/health/coronavirus/xenophobic-behavior-on-the-rise-towards-asian-americans-in-utah-in-relation-to-covid-19-misinformation/
as I predicted.. RT @GarrettClif: The giant discount store chain, Costco, is now telling its customers that they cannot return overbought items purchased in bulk during the coronavirus outbreak. The top products that canny be returned are paper products, water and Lysol.
As long as you're stuck inside hand sani is less essential than hand soap. And it's more effective for your hands. But yeah, Lysol would be nice. I've been making bleach sanitizer but it's not versatile for everything.
As many of you already know, my husband (Emergency Medicine Physician) was diagnosed with COVID a few weeks ago. Our children got it approximately 4 days later and I was tested on day 5, which came back negative. I had a few symptoms, which I will mention below so I am not sure if this was a false negative or maybe I could have turned positive later on â€“ who knows! I wanted to share our story here on my blog where it can have a more permanent place and where I can organize all of the information in one place. I know that IG stories can get confusing and it can be frustrating to fast forward to the exact part you want information about. Important to note: this is just our EXPERIENCE. This is not about us giving out medical advice. We just want to help others in any way that we can but you ultimately need to make any and all decisions yourself as a family to see what would be best for you. The vitamins that I mention here are just based on research that we did but you should always talk to your own provider before starting any new supplements or medications. Before I begin, here are some other COVID-19 posts that I wrote recently that you may want to check out: Where can I donate during the COVID-19 Pandemic? || Acts of Kindness || 30 Days of Activities to Clear Your Mind During Quarantine || Uplifting Movies and Binge Worth TV Shows || Mental health resources || Uplifting COVID-19 Cases from those of you in my community COVID-19 | Our StoryHusbandâ€™s Symptoms/Story: A few weeks ago I returned home from work and my husband was looking under the weather. He had the kids all day during my 12 hour shift and said that he felt body aches and chills. Immediately, we assumed COVID because of our high exposure. He did mention that he felt some slight aches on Friday/Saturday (the two days prior) but he did long runs outside (on huge hills) and assumed it was just delayed onset muscle soreness. Day 2-3 seemed to be the worst for him with fever 104, chills, sore throat, dry cough, chest pain, severe body aches. On day 4 fevers subsided and never came back. He loss his sense of taste and smell and continued with congestion, sore throat, body aches and chest pain until day 8-9. After that, he recovered completely and by day 10 was completely asymptomatic. He was tested on day 3 and received the phone call that he was positive on day 5. The kids : the kids developed fevers, congestion, dry cough around day 4 of my husband being ill. The kids never had any issues and the fever was gone in 24 hours. Our middle (4 year old) seemed to have it the worst and the fever lasted a bit longer with her but all did great overall. myself : I am currently 24 week pregnant and I was tested on day 5 because I had a dry cough, weird post nasal drip with phlegm in my throat and headaches. My test came back negative. My headaches lasted about 5 days and I still (on day 14) have this phlegm issue going on but thatâ€™s it. Whether its allergy related (Iâ€™ve never had allergies), a false negative test, or something else, who knows! What we did during 14 day quarantineThis is going to look different for EVERYONE. There is NO right answer. You need to discuss this with your immediate family and figure out what is best for ALL of you. Once I came home from work on Sunday March 15th, my husband was visibly not feeling well. He was with the kids that entire day during my 12 hour shift and RARELY complains about being sick. That night he spiked a fever (104) and had body aches, chest pain, sore throat, etc. That night he moved into our spare bedroom, where he slept for the following 14 days. He technically thinks his symptoms started Friday when he had mild body aches that he didnâ€™t think much of (he works out frequently and recently started running our hills more). We suspect that he was probably contagious for 4-5 days BEFORE Sunday. We were obviously all exposed but we wanted to DECREASE the exposure, especially while he was febrile. He stayed in that one room until he was afebrile and then he wore a mask (as did I) for the next 2 weeks. For him to be in TOTAL isolation wasnâ€™t an option that I personally thought was appropriate because we already had exposure and I knew he needed our support and love. He didnâ€™t cook ANY meals for those two weeks and usually stayed 6 feet away from me. Our kids also got it about 5 days later so once that happened we didnâ€™t worry about him being close to the children as much. He used his own bathroom for those two weeks as well. I cleaned the most used areas of the house about 2-3 times a day. This included wiping down all surfaces, door knobs, etc. with clorox wipes and spray. I also vacuumed and mopped the kitchen and dining room daily since we spent a lot of time in there. We opened the windows EVERY SINGLE DAY despite the temperature outside and aired out the house. We spent as much time as possible outdoors in our yard for emotional healing and to keep the germs outside of the house. We live in a secluded neighborhood in the woods so this was possible for us, this may not be possible for everyone (i.e in big cities). I also used a humidifier (viruses hate humidity) and an air purifier on every floor of the house. How we decon after work1.) cardboard box in trunk. Shoes NEVER come into garage or home. They come off after shift and go immediately into cardboard box in trunk. 2.) Scrubs come off AT work and thrown into a garbage bag (immediately washed at home on sanitize cycle with vinegar or bleach). If possible, shower at work. We have an outdoor shower that we are using! 3.) wash hair daily / wear scrub cap 4.) wipe down carseat and steering wheel with Lysol/bleach wipes once home 5.) washing hands 7494749 times in between all of this 6.) limiting eating at work. To be honest, eating a full meal before going in is our goal and not eating through the shift because of contamination. 7.) no jewelry. Bring limited items to work because anything you do bring will be considered contaminated. Use your phone the least amount of times as possible. 8.) wipe down your computer space and keyboard before your shift begins. Try to only use that one space and clean it often. 9.) PROPER PPE at all times. No exceptions. COVID-19 | Resources | Studies | ArticlesGENERAL RESOURCES COVID-19 || Spoon fed version â€“ really easy to red facts all in one place!

It is empowering and educational || LINK HERE Great breakdown of daily review of COVID-19 studies HERE While reports out of Wuhan, China suggested that this illness present with more â€œflu like illnessâ€, a recent study suggest that symptoms have been much more vague with the critical care patients â€“ â€œchest pain, headaches, altered mental statusâ€ and gastrointestinal symptoms such as â€œnausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.â€ Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1 || How long the virus lasts on certain surfaces General information about food safety, groceries, takeout Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis || This study published recently in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal estimates that about 0.66% of patients who become infected with the virus will die (much different than previous estimates). When undetected infections arenâ€™t taken into account, researchers found the coronavirus death rate was 1.38% (which is obviously the biggest concern since a lot of these cases most likely go undetected or that these people are not tested). This is still much higher than the flu which is 0.1%. Incubation period | Median incubation period is estimated to be 5 days. For 97.5% of infected persons, symptoms appear by 11.5 days. Fewer than 2.5% are symptomatic within 2.2 days. Estimated median IT to fever was 5.7 days. This is HUGE when it comes to spreading the infection without knowing you are infected yet. Bottom line? STAY HOME. Here is an overview of incubation time. Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019 || Very small sample size and not yet peer reviewed but bottom line is in milder illness, the virus was most infectious when patients had more mild symptoms and most infectious PRIOR to day 5 of illness. â€œPeak concentrations were reached before Day 5 and were more than 1,000 times higherâ€ than those seen in SARS patients, the authors wrote. This may be different than patients with more severe illness requiring hospitalization. SUPPLEMENTSAs far as supplements go, my husband (and kids) were taking Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D, Melatonin and drinking a lot of hot green tea. Another KEY COMPONENT is staying as hydrated as possible so DRINK DRINK DRINK! I will go more in depth about doses (and also pregnancy) here soon.

Asian people have nothing to do with the coronavirus. Donâ€™t spray Lysol in their face. Donâ€™t threaten to burn their restaurants. If you want to treat anyone bad go to Trumpâ€™s office or fly to China and take it up with Xi Jinping. Im tired of this mistreatment #coronavirus
Awfully nice for @grainger to offer Lysol ---pre-#COVID19 price about $5.50---for $12.41, and only if you buy a dozen. Excellent #pricegouging! https://www.grainger.com/search/cleaning-and-janitorial/cleaning-chemicals/disinfectants-and-sanitizers?optOut=0&searchQuery=lysol+disinfectant+spray&sst=1
Because maybe that can of aerosol lysol was the only thing left on the shelf at the store?
Before #covid19 I love how my city was hand holding, so nice and helpful, letâ€™s build homes, & feed families. And now. I have a 65 year old woman running her cart into me for five #Lysol bottles. Hereâ€™s her photo:
Below is what a police officer has said about what is going on in our country now. I donâ€™t want any comments on this, Iâ€™m just posting. NOW WHAT THE COP SAID: I try not to live under a rock, letâ€™s be real. Iâ€™m a cop and see things that arenâ€™t reported in media. However, I also try my best to pay attention to my surroundings and with that being said. Our Government is under attack from within. If you donâ€™t believe so, then you probably also believe that this is the first time the Corona virus has been identified. Think about whatâ€™s transpired over the last few months. The government has presented every possible demographic including a self proclaimed socialist as a democratic candidate because they fear something they canâ€™t control. The impeachment hoax failed and immediately Pelosi vowed to exhaust efforts in overthrowing Trump. If you currently can see this post then until last week you were living in the most thriving economy this nation has ever seen in my lifetime. Only due to the fact that the person in control couldnâ€™t be bought. If you think for one second this â€œpandemicâ€ is not media driven, and controlled by the radical people in powerful places....well...go back to sleep under the rock you crawled out from. Oh, and go ahead at this point and click on my name and follow the steps to unfriend or unfollow me as well because you really arenâ€™t going to like this. This thing has killed less people in the same time frame then cigarettes, cancer, drunk driving, domestic violence, car crashes, cross stitching accidents (j/k on the last one but probably close), stabbings, overdoses, and please donâ€™t get me started on abortion. Wake up!!! This is what the beginning of socialism looks like! They are controlling what you buy...bc itâ€™s what you think you need, where you go...bc itâ€™s where they tell you not to go, and how to live...bc you now fear the very existence of anything outside of your home and control. They are leading with fear. Causing you to panic like sheep. They are crashing the stock market to run on a failing economy, because itâ€™s all they have left. What is this saying to all of the countries that have opposed us for decades but, couldnâ€™t defeat us? Itâ€™s saying...biological war fare will make these idiots glued to CNN and every other liberal news source panic and run for the hills. You donâ€™t need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns! Now wash your hands and live the life they donâ€™t want you to have!
Benzalkonium Chloride is relatively less effective than eg lysol wipes for sanitizing coronavirus. It works, but it requires like 15 or 20 minutes of contact to deactivate them. Incidentally, I only figured this out _after_ accidentally buying a case of these when I meant to buy a box.
Besides the fact there are 40 endemic coronavirus' that already affect humans
Blaming gloves for all the wrong procedures you just mentioned afterwards is a bit much. Do not touch an elevator button without cover. Do not touch a grocery cart without hand cover. And do not go anywhere near a public bathroom for any reason, gloves or not. Wash before. Wash after. Use throwaway gloves or have three or four pair in rotation and wash or lysol them. But good God use gloves.
Blood on their hands and itâ€™s terrifying at the very least.

Bola.net - Berbagai tindakan pencegahan guna memutus mata rantai penyebaran pandemi virus corona (Covid-19) terus dilakukan. Salah satunya adalah penyemprotan disinfektan yang sedang digalakkan. Tidak hanya dilakukan oleh instansi pemerintah, masyarakat juga banyak yang membuat cairan disinfektan sendiri. Penyemprotan pun dilakukan di tempat-tempat yang memiliki intensitas tinggi terhadap kontak dan interaksi langsung dengan banyak orang seperti fasilitas umum, perkantoran, hingga pemukiman warga. Namun, tidak banyak diketahui bahwa cairan disinfektan ini sebenarnya memiliki dampak yang buruk apabila bersentuhan langsung dengan manusia. Penggunaan disinfektan ini pertama kali dilakukan Pemerintah Indonesia secara resmi pada penerimaan WNI yang telah kembali dari Wuhan, kota episenter virus corona. Pada saat itu, Pemerintah berhasil mengevakuasi sebanyak 237 WNI dan 1 WNA pada tanggal 12 Februari 2020 yang lalu. Proses evakuasi ini menggunakan pesawat Batik Air dan tiba di Bandara Hang Nadim, Batam untuk selanjutnya dilakukan prosedur karantina selama 14 hari seperti rekomendasi Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO). Saat seluruh penumpang turun dari pesawat, petugas yang mengenakan alat perlindungan diri (APD) telah bersiap untuk menyemprotkan cairan disinfektan. Penyemprotan cairan disinfektan ini dirasa oleh banyak pihak menuai banyak kontroversi. Sebab, keamanan serta efektivitas dari cairan disinfektan bagi manusia ini belum terbukti. 1 dari 5 Kandungan SenyawaKandungan senyawa yang terkandung di dalam cairan disinfektan ini beragam di antaranya adalah senyawa chlorin, hydrogen peroksida, creosote, aldehid, quaternary ammonium compunds (quats), idiofor, dan alkohol. Selain itu, cairan disinfektan pada dasarnya memiliki kandungan senyawa yang disebut dengan biosida dengan kadar yang cukup tinggi. Merujuk pada Klikdokter, formula untuk membuat cairan disinfektan ini harus terdaftar pada badan EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). Senyawa yang terformulasikan dalam cairan disinfektan ini bekerja dengan cara merusak sel tubuh kuman, bakteri, dan virus. Oleh karena itu, cairan disinfektan lebih efektif digunakan dan diaplikasikan pada permukaan benda-benda yang ada di sekitar. Penyemprotan cairan disinfektan ini dapat dilakukan pada benda-benda yang sering terjamah oleh manusia seperti gagang pintu, toilet, meja, kursi, saklar lampu, dan lain sebagainya. 2 dari 5 Gangguan PernapasanBeberapa kandungan senyawa yang terdapat pada cairan disinfektan disinyalir dapat menimbulkan gangguan kesehatan apabila terhirup. Tubuh manusia akan merespon hal tersebut apabila terjadi dalam jangka waktu yang pendek dengan mengeluarkan zat beracun tersebut melalui sistem metabolisme tubuh. Namun, apabila tindakan tersebut dilakukan secara jangka panjang, maka sistem pertahanan tubuh perlahan akan menurun dan dapat menimbulkan gangguan kesehatan pada sistem pernapasan. Sebab, cairan disinfektan sangatlah berpotensi untuk terhirup secara tidak sadar ketika disemprotkan secara langsung pada tubuh manusia. Untuk itu, hindari penyemprotan cairan disinfektan secara berulang-ulang untuk menghilangkan dan mematikan virus coronacovid-19. Cukup cuci tangan untuk menangkal penyebaran virus corona Covid-19 secara rutin pada waktu-waktu yang penting. Dengan metode cuci tangan, Anda dapat mengoptimalkan tindakan pencegahan melalui cara yang aman dan meminimalisir munculnya gangguan kesehatan lain. 3 dari 5 KeracunanCairan disinfektan dirasa tidak efektif untuk membunuh virus, kuman, dan bakteri apabila disemprotkan secara langsung ke tubuh manusia. Sebab, cairan disinfektan hanya mampu menyentuh bagian luar tubuh manusia dan pakaian serta benda yang menempel pada tubuh. Padahal, virus, kuman, dan bakteri mungkin telah masuk dan menginfeksi sel-sel di dalam tubuh. Untuk itu, cairan disinfektan sebaiknya tidak disarankan untuk disemprotkan langsung pada tubuh manusia. Bukan mematikan virus, langkah tersebut justru mungkin akan memicu masalah kesehatan lainnya pada manusia seperti keracunan apabila tertelan. Untuk itu, hindari untuk menyentuh mulut ketika terjadi kontak dengan cairan disinfektan. Selalu tutup segitiga wajah apabila Anda keluar rumah. Anda dapat menggunakan masker sebagai tindakan pencegahan terhadap dampak buruk penyemprotan cairan disinfektan di tempat-tempat umum. 4 dari 5 Bahaya untuk Mata, Hidung, dan KulitDilansir dari Liputan6, kandungan lysol yang dapat ditambahkan ke dalam cairan disinfektan dapat menimbulkan alergi dan sangat berbahaya apabila terhirup, tertelan, atau kontak dengan mata dan kulit. Selain itu, melalui akun Twitter, WHO Indonesia pada tanggal 29 Maret 2020 yang lalu mengingatkan untuk tidak menyemprotkan cairan disinfektan secara langsung ke tubuh manusia. Sebab, kandungan yang ada pada cairan disinfektan dapat menyebabkan masalah kesehatan apabila terkena selaput lendir seperti mata dan mulut. "#Indonesia, jangan menyemprot disinfektan langsung ke badan seseorang, karena hal ini bisa membahayakan. Gunakan disinfektan hanya pada permukaan benda-benda. Ayo #LawanCOVID19 dengan tepat," demikian pernyataan WHO Indonesia. Sumber: Merdekacom/Disadur dari: Bolacom/Penulis: Mutiara Anggraini/Editor: Wiwig Prayugi/Dipublikasi: 31 Maret 2020 5 dari 5
BREAKING NEWS: This is just in. COVID-19 stated that Americans were not prepared, aren't practising preventative care against him and will wait to the useless stay at home order is over. People, if you have to go out. Please.... Follow these instructions. Cover your hair, use a mask, cover your clothes, shoes and wear gloves. Carry hand sanitizer. When you are safely at home. Please discard your mask, disrobe in a safe room and shower immediately. Lastly, spray your home with Lysol and disinfect anything you purchased from the store. Be safe!

"Bro, you guys are getting masks??? We have no masks and now that the manufacturers for our work gloves are shut down (regular everyday PPE, not medical), weâ€™re rationing those as well. We barely have Lysol and purell wipes and finding a container is like having a pack of cigarettes in prison. The encouragement for social distancing is instantly negated when weâ€™re surrounded by all these new hires who require us to show them how to do their job in a work space meant for a single person. While miles of conveyors are running and random alarms go off, weâ€™re basically having to scream constantly to be sure weâ€™re heard while having them stand 6 feet away and hoping they can see well enough to understand while we explain how to troubleshoot their issues.

As for those people who walked out, I can see why. Theyâ€™re basically working in Ground Zero and already had multiple confirmed cases at their FC. My FC has had no confirmed cases (yet, bc at a minimum 50% exposure rate, itâ€™s inevitable) and theyâ€™re still freaking out. There have been people I havenâ€™t seen since UPT began being excused because their scared. I can only imagine what itâ€™d be like in their shoes knowing people at work have been diagnosed. Even if the FC was cleaned to CDC standards, I wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable unless EXTREME measures were placed like a much more dramatic staggering OF shifts instead of just staggering breaks ON shift. Iâ€™d be ok coming in 5-6 days a week at adjusted hours if it meant Iâ€™m surrounded by less people.

In conclusionâ€” sounds like how Amazon is handling it is a case by case basis. Right now, my experience is 4/10 would not recommend"
But is it safe to spray bleach all around the house on furniture, tiles, wood, clothes, kitchen, etc?
Buyer...er hoarders beware. RT @GarrettClif: The giant discount store chain, Costco, is now telling its customers that they cannot return overbought items purchased in bulk during the coronavirus outbreak. The top products that canny be returned are paper products, water and Lysol.
Caile, pero voy a ponerme medio sociopata con esto del Coronavirus, nos vamos a dar la inhalada de nuestras vidas con Lysol.
Cairan disinfektan lebih efektif digunakan dan diaplikasikan pada permukaan benda-benda yang ada di sekitar. Brilio.net - Tepat satu bulan yang lalu, pemerintah mengumumkan kasus pertama pasien positif corona di Indonesia. Kini jumlahnya pun kian meningkat. Terbaru data dari pemerintah mencatat per Rabu (1/4) jumlah seluruh kasus pasien positif corona Covid-19 ada 1.677 orang. Peningkatan kasus pasien corona ini tak hanya terjadi di Indonesia, namun juga di berbagai belahan dunia. Kini ada tiga negara yang terdampak paling parah di luar China, yakni Amerika Serikat, Italia dan juga Spanyol. Ketiga negara tersebut bahkan kini sudah menginjak angka lebih dari 80 ribu kasus. Hingga kini belum ditemukan vaksin yang dapat mengatasi virus yang berasal dari Wuhan, China ini. Direktur Jenderal Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus mengatakan, kapasitas pengetesan yang luas dan menjaga jarak sosial merupakan langkah terbaik untuk melawan pandemi corona hingga vaksin ditemukan. "Langkah-langkah agresif untuk menemukan, mengisolasi, menguji, merawat, dan melacak tidak hanya cara terbaik dan tercepat. Mereka juga cara terbaik untuk mencegah penyebaran virus," kata Ghebreyesus, seperti dikutip brilio.net dari Business Insider Singapore, Kamis (2/4). Bahkan pemerintah Indonesia juga menegaskan untuk lakukan social distancing atau jaga jarak disertai proses belajar, bekerja dan beribadah di rumah. Tindakan ini dilakukan agar tidak banyak lagi orang yang terjangkit virus Corona. Masyarakat pun kini mulai waspada hingga melakukan berbagai cara, ada yang menggunakan antiseptik ada pula yang menyemprot disinfektan. Tak sedikit dari masyarakat yang kini menyemprotkan cairan disinfektan ke tubuh, jalanan, hingga membuat bilik khusus disinfektan. Namun penggunaan disinfektan ke tubuh merupakan cara yang efektif? Berikut brilio.net himpun dari berbagai sumber, kenali kegunaan disinfektan dan antiseptik, pada Kamis (2/4). View Image foto: freepik.com Semenjak corona menyebar ke Indonesia, penyemprotan dengan menggunkaan disinfektan marak dilakukan. Nggak hanya pemerintah, namun masyarakat juga berlomba-lomba melakukannya secara mandiri. Penyemprotan ini menyasar fasilitas publik seperti perkantoran, pasar, hingga sarana transportasi. Tetapi belakangan banyak yang melakukan penyemprotan ini ke tubuh manusia. WHO sebenarnya juga tidak merekomendasikan penyemprotan disinfektan ke tubuh manusia. Selain itu dilansir brilio.net dari liputan6.com, Kamis (2/4),Profesor Wiku Adisasmito, Ketua Tim Pakar Gugus Penanganan Covid-19, tidak merekomendasikan penggunaan bilik disinfektan atau disinfektan chamber. Sebab menurutnya, hal itu sangat berbahaya karena tidak mengenakkan bagian kulit sensitif pada manusia secara langsung. Disinfektan sendiri merupakan jenis cairan pembersih yang umumnya dibuat dari hidgrogen, alhohol, creosote atau clorin yang bertujuaan membunuh berbagai macam kuman, bakteri, virus hingga mikroorganisme berbahaya lainnya yang terdapat pada ruangan ataupun permukaan benda. Selain itu, cairan disinfektan pada dasarnya memiliki kandungan senyawa yang disebut dengan biosida dengan kadar yang cukup tinggi. Oleh karena itu, cairan disinfektan lebih efektif digunakan dan diaplikasikan pada permukaan benda-benda yang ada di sekitar. Penyemprotan cairan disinfektan ini dapat dilakukan pada benda-benda yang sering terjamah oleh manusia seperti gagang pintu, toilet, meja, kursi, saklar lampu, keran,dan lain sebagainya. Sementara untuk pembersihan pencegahan umum dapat menggunakan air dan sabun atau deterjen lainnya. Tentunya hal yang perlu diperhatikan saat menggunakan disinfektan adalah memeriksa label dan menggunakan sesuai instruksi yang ada. View Image foto: freepik.com Beberapa kandungan senyawa desinfektan ini disinyalir dapat mengakibatkan gangguan kesehatan bagi manusia. Apabila terjadi dalam jangka panjang dan terhirup oleh manusia maka sistem pertahanan tubuh perlahan akan menurun dan dapat menimbulkan gangguan kesehatan pada sistem pernapasan. Sebab, cairan disinfektan sangatlah berpotensi untuk terhirup secara tidak sadar ketika disemprotkan secara langsung pada tubuh manusia. Selain gangguan pernapasan disinfektan yang disemprotkan langsung pada tubuh manusia,juga memicu masalah kesehatan lainnya seperti keracunan apabila tertelan. Untuk itu hindari untuk mnyentuh mulut ketika terjadi kontak dengan cairan disinfektan. Diketahui kandungan lysol yang dapat ditambahkan ke dalam cairan disinfektan dapat menimbulkan alergi dan sangat berbahaya apabila terhirup, tertelan, atau kontak dengan mata dan kulit. View Image foto: freepik.com Kini selain disinfektan banyak orang yang kini juga tengah menggunakan antiseptik demi mencegah terjangkit virus Corona. Pada umumnya antiseptik dan disinfektan sama-sama dari bahan kimia yang mampu menghancurkan atau menghambat mikroorganisme yang terdapat dalam jaringan hidup. Namun perbedaannya antiseptik digunakan pada tubuh manusia, seperti diterapkan pada permukaan tangan. Sementara disinfektan biasanya digunakan untuk ruangan, lantai, peralatan, dan kamar mandi. Antiseptik memiliki beragam kegunaan baik di dalam maupun di luar pengaturan medis. Dalam kedua pengaturan, mereka diterapkan pada kulit atau selaput lendir.Berikut kegunaan antiseptik: 1. Mencuci tangan. Para tenaga medis biasanya menggunakan antiseptik untuk mencuci dan gosok tangan ketika di rumah sakit. 2. Membasmi kuman selaput lendir. Antiseptik dapat diterapkan pada uretra, kandung kemih, atau vagina untuk membersihkan daerah tersebut sebelum memasukkan kateter. Mereka juga dapat membantu mengobati infeksi di area ini. 3. Membersihkan kulit sebelum operasi. Antiseptik diterapkan pada kulit sebelum segala jenis operasi, untuk melindungi terhadap mikroorganisme berbahaya yang mungkin ada pada kulit. 4. Mengobati infeksi kulit. Kamu dapat membeli antiseptik OTC untuk mengurangi risiko infeksi pada luka ringan, luka bakar, dan luka. Contohnya termasuk hidrogen peroksida dan alkohol gosok. 5. Mengobati infeksi tenggorokan dan mulut. Beberapa pelega tenggorokan mengandung antiseptik untuk membantu mengatasi sakit tenggorokan malam karena infeksi bakteri.

Carolyn Pierce I do not use the same gloves and I wash my hands all the time. I used only one time gloves when I shopping and go to public places and put them for garbage after I use sanitizer when I m living store or public places. When I come back home I wash my hands with warm water and soap for 50 second min and for all my grocery I put them on site , meat ,eggs just wipe packages (you can desinfected if you want gloves also use lysol or chlorox) When I order anything from amazon or chewy for my pets I m waiting for couple days be open boxes also desinfected all items you can spray shipping boxes with 409 or Lysol . I m wearing mask if I'm going to public places everybody should wearing mask trust me CDC said already (also you can buy face shield and wipe after you left store used spray be desinfected your face shield or wash your mask if you come back home. .You will be soon go to store and wear mask . You do not need stay home all the times you need exercise and stay in good shape also I take vitamins C and D and all vitamins depends on your age .All this hard effort should cut your risk catch this virus or any viruses because they mutation all the times. Everybody need fresh air I was hiking finally after 3 weeks I was sick and coughing hard for last couple weeks I do not know if I had coronavirus but I had something for sure no fever so "not test for me" .After shades hiking I got super sweaty almost like I get bath but I think fresh air and all day hiking help me so much I felt after so good . I wish you and all very best with adopted our new life .
Cats and dogs can both get Corona Virus. It is a different strain of Corona. If they have had their shots they are vaccinated. The type dogs and cats get is not transferred to humans. That said, if you have pets, the virus can live on fur (not sure the amount of time). Lysol is toxic to cats. So be careful with that.
Children are concerned about the health and wellbeing of our parents!!! My dad canâ€™t #socialdistance in prison!! He has no Lysol, rubbing alcohol or sanitizer - the phones arenâ€™t clean either!!!

Citando Shini Isolamento vertical dÃ¡ certinho: Ã‰ uma utopia isolamento numa paÃ­s como o BR. Muito quem sabe seria possÃ­vel em paÃ­ses pequenos ou estados federados (se o federalismo de fato funcionasse) de modo que a estrutura pÃºblica funcionasse. Esquece polÃ­tica e ideologia, nossa cultura nÃ£o Ã© de vida independente, a maioria imensa das pessoas vive numa casa com familiares e nÃ£o tem opÃ§Ã£o. Pegue o meu caso, estou em FlorianÃ³polis (IDH acima da mÃ©dia), tem dinheiro na conta para comprar comida pela Internet e nÃ£o saio de casa tem acho que um mÃªs, estou me preparando psicologicamente para ir atÃ© setembro nessa, mas no mÃ­nimo atÃ© o fim de maio. NÃ£o tem velhos nem crianÃ§as em casa, exceto minha mulher nÃ£o ir visitar os pais. Buenas, Agora coloque um filho ou neto na equaÃ§Ã£o, mais um avÃ´/avÃ³/tio, nÃ£o Ã© incomum nÃºcleos familiares completos numa mesma casa no BR. Agora acrescente falta de grana, falta de estrutura pÃºblica (nem mesmo com grana os mercados entregam no prazo, a maioria nem oferece esse serviÃ§o), mais a possibilidade de um familiar precisar trabalhar, ainda que outro possa se isolar, pense tambÃ©m que faltam mÃ¡scaras e trata-se de um vÃ­rus extremamente contagioso. Ademais pobre nem tem dinheiro para mÃ¡scara, isso Ã© luxo. Essa semana vi um defensor pÃºblico de famÃ­lia rica professor em um curso que faÃ§o querer criminalizar a patroa de 63 anos que dependia da empregada que por sua vez pegou a doenÃ§a dela e morreu em um dia (como se nÃ£o fosse morrer em um dia se pegasse de alguÃ©m na comunidade onde morava), resultado, pessoal dispensando as empregadas, que nÃ£o vÃ£o morrer inicialmente de COVID, vÃ£o passar misÃ©ria antes e pegar SARS2 de qualquer jeito. [sobre esse assunto, demiti-las e colocar robÃ´s de limpeza sÃ³ vai ferrar quem mais precisa, esse tipo de pensamento jÃ¡ foi explicado por vÃ¡rios economistas que apenas a inteligentsia nobre pensa nesse tipo de soluÃ§Ã£o, aÃ­ Ã© colocar na conta do governo sustentar essa camada enorme da populaÃ§Ã£o = mais impostos] Para complicar mais, temos Ã¡lcool, panos desinfetantes, aspirador com HEPA, Lysol em spray, e ainda assim Ã© um saco, Ã© impossÃ­vel desinfetar tudo, e basta um descuido, especialmente num prÃ©dio (confesso mais um motivo que me arrependo de comprar apartamento).

Corona is just a type of virus. That's why Lysol is effective against it - it's a known quantity, not a new type. This particular strain is just bad, and spread before it got a specific name like MERS or SARS. (I'm so tired of the Facebook posts that say obviously this is a hoax, corona can't be new or old bottles of Lysol or Clorox wipes wouldn't say they're effective against it.)
Coronavirus can live on surfaces for up to three days. Here's how to clean the right way. https://www.reviewed.com/laundry-cleaning/features/how-to-disinfect-surfaces-from-coronavirus-clorox-lysol
Coronavirus is a category that already existed. Covid-19 is new.
Coronavirus is something that been on a Lysol can in all the 99.9 things it kills it's listed do how shockingly new is it ???? Hmmm
Coronavirus isn't brand new it's been one of the 99.9 things Lysol kills it has it right on the can??? The jig is up?

"COVID-19 is the name we have given to the phenomena that has arisen recently due to the discovery that the finely dispersed cellulose strands in a roll of toilet paper can be converted into gold using very common household supplies. 

Someone posted a recipe online to perform this conversion using only isopropanol, ethanol-based hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, albumen from chicken eggs and an n95 facemask as a filter.

Ever since this information was made public, there have been shortages of the precursor and all the required materials for this recipe. This has had a massive effect on the economy and stock market, as gold is at risk of losing all value.

As a result of this, almost all governments have invented some silly fake disease to keep people at home and prevent them from buying toilet paper in bulk."
Covid-19 popped up on my pc , sprayed it w lysol , now it wont turn on . Any tips ?
COVID-19 started because we cleaned our desks with shaving cream instead of Lysol wipes in elementary school

"Day 21. I have to walk the dog in the mornings but half the time Iâ€™m sprinting in the middle of the street because people donâ€™t GD social distance in Midtown.

Hating: Being in an apartment and not able to have a full decontamination zone outside of the door. Instead thereâ€™s one at the door where everything comes off, shoes go on a damp towel with bleach, lysol for keys, sanitizer to be able to lock the door and hand soap to wash in the kitchen. Then everything goes into the laundry.

Dear quinger86, I agree! It just saddens me that lives are being lost & all people care about is the money. It saddens me that people are not caring about the lives being lost because of their greed. The nation is in crisis & there is only a hand full of us that are trying to do what we can to help. It's not like I'm going to stop reporting these sellers, but there are so many sellers & so many products. My recent message was about Lysol, but I see that my pictures were removed. It's like it is just being swept under the rug. It's like to be able to purchase these items to try to stay alive, you have to have money & if you don't have the money you may as well die anyway. eBay was showing that they cared a month ago & now it's like they like the money more then the thought of saving lives. It's just really making more people the way it sthink it's alright & that they might as well start doing it too. Some had understood a month ago & stopped selling the hand sanitizer. But, now it's like the flood gates have been opened & death is ok if they have money in their pockets. A month ago I spoke the an eBay concierge & she made me feel like we were ALL working together to stop this from happening. But, now it's like it doesn't matter to anyone. It's like you can't get a hold of anyone with eBay & they are like people are dying without these products, oh well. With the way it is going it won't matter if they are reported, because for each one reported 5 more will pop up. Their business is all computer based, so they would be able to stop it fast if they really wanted to! With people selling so many other things they could afford to miss out on a few bucks during this time. If they just took the main names of these products like Lysol, Purell, Clorox, Pledge, Mr. Clean & so on they could stop it right off! But, instead they are only using COVID 19 or coronavirus which isn't going to do anything. People are now just using HIV, Aids, SARS, H1N1 & such to list their products so they can be found. But, they generally use the product's name in the listing. Or words like sanitizer, disinfectant or cleaner, which could still be used to find these products & would work better then COVID 19 or coronavirus! I just find it heart breaking! Ok, sorry I'm done. Thank you for your message!
Dennis Chastnant When the appointment was made I asked the representative about the safety measures they took. All questions were answered to my satisfaction, so I assumed we were safe in allowing him inside. Before they send out a technician, they ask the homeowner about precautions they've taken so as not to expose the technician. My husband and I had been self-quarantining for about 2 weeks. I didn't get close to him but rather kept my distance. I sprayed with Lysol and wiped down everything he touched after he left. I'm sure that he was as concerned about being exposed as we were considering he has a wife and two small children at home. What I'm wondering now is whether our technician had any interaction with the technician who tested positive for COVID-19 or did we possibly have the same technician. I have not received a call from Spectrum so I'm hoping not.

dragonfly2be said: Posted 10 mins ago Yeah the automotive industry is sadly not known for its quality treatment of its techs. Not sure if this will help but... If he doesnt generally wear disposable gloves have him start. We use black nitrite ones from Auto Zone. We have a small auto repair shop. Were putting on gloves, using Clorox wipe or homemade wipe to clean exterior door handle, open door, wiping drivers side door, hood release, steering wheel, shifter (and leather seats if applicable, then spraying car with lysol. ) Shutting doors for 10 minutes. Changing gloves. Then well pull cars into shop. Once done we are basically reverse cleaning and spraying lysol again. It maynot "help" but atleast gives us a feeling of a measure of protection from anything that maybe living in area or surfaces. Thank you. He does wear gloves - they have skyrocketed in price! So glad he had some extra supply already. His shop does not supply them. His shop doesn't supply anything to wipe down the steering wheels and shifters, and he's having to reuse his gloves if they didn't get filthy. He's very good about not touching his face - shard of metal got in his eye once at work so he's gotten very careful since that happened 10 years ago. Techs really are treated terribly by most employers.

Even if you bring mask, alcohol and lysol (think about those who can't afford this and again masks are limited, it should be just for the sick and our frontliners) and what if you become a carrier of covid-19, think about your family. RT @pawawawofficial: If they declare martial law, letâ€™s go out with masks, alcohol and Lysol.
Every time I sneeze at work my coworker yells out â€œCORONAVIRUSâ€ .. yes in Cardiâ€™s voice then reaches his arm over his desk to spray Lysol at my desk and Iâ€™m tired of working in these kind of conditions.

Fools didnâ€™t lock up the Lysol Wipes. Amateurs.
For diy wipes use 1 cup 70% ethyl alcohol, 1 tbsp Dawn dish soap, and 2 cups water. Add essential oils for extra flavor. Clorox with water. You can use this on the steering wheel and non fabric surfaces. Or you can use ammonia. I saw some in Job Lot Dedham the other day. 1 per customer. Lysol spray the inside of the vehicle. Diy Lysol spray is basically alcohol and a bunch of essential oils. Soapy water also works. Car detailing and air out. Use Lysol laundry sanitizer for the cloth parts. There is also an EPA list of products that work against this virus. https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2

From what I was told Corona is a mutation from other Covid-19 on the "Lysol" can... Mersa and SARS are a form of Covid-19 ...
FYI those disinfectant wipes donâ€™t actually kill off the coronavirus. It says so on the Lysol brand package on the back near the top

Walked around my yard today....picked a few wild flowers since I don't have any "real" flowers in my yard. Husband is bored....bored...bored....he has no hobbies....I go around two or three times a day and wipe lightswitches et. down and he is getting a little annoyed with me....he has a thing about smells and I told him get use to it....I'm only using lysol wipes and not clorox which really smells and I have two gallons on backup....LOL... GB I remember you saying your husband was like mine....how are you handling it??? How is he handling it???? Tell me before I lose my mind.... Made a big pan of chicken spaghetti....tomorrow will make chicken soup with the left over chicken.... Printed out quite a few cards to send to family and friends....I love getting personal mail so hope they do too....On Saturday, I dropped off (porch, no contact) some coloring books and stickers to one of my young Mom's and the kids called me last night to thank me....the little seven year old told me "Ms. Peggy when this coronavirus is over we are coming to your house for breakfast and I want pancakes." LOL...Told him I look forward to that!!! And in my stash closet I found a new Olaf waffle maker...knew I was holding on to that for a reason... Stay safe, stay home, stay healthy....
Gee, maybe because wealthy people dropping $7,000 on toilet paper, paper towels, is like us spending $5 at the Dollar tree. Maybe that's why $1 bottles of Lysol are all over eBay for upwards of $100.
General question: Lets say you have to have automotive work done in your vehicle and it requires a mechanic to get in your car, does this mean that you should let your car sit with in the parking lot for a couple hours before going in and using Lysol/Clorox wipes on the inside?
Georgia Tech's custodial staff have altered their cleaning practices to focus more on surface cleanliness and disinfection. This includes augmenting the green cleaning protocol to include Lysol spray and Clorox wipes, which are CDC- and EPA-approved for human coronavirus.
Get a spray bottle at the dollar store or Walmart. I mix 2 tablespoons of bleach into 1 litre of room temp water and then funnel the mixture into a spray bottle. Much more convenient than trying to find specific brand name products that are usually sold out and definitely cheaper.
Ginger Gunter they arenâ€™t providing us gloves and they are almost impossible to find right now. If you have any to spare, maybe leave a pair out for your carrier. They are also pointless to wear really unless you expect us to change them after every house. If a house has a resident with COVID-19 and we touch their mailbox and then touch your mail or box, it is now on your box whether we had gloves on or not. Gloves do not stop it from spreading. The best thing to do is wipe your box with a Clorox/Lysol wipe everyday and open all mail immediately and wash hands afterwards. Use common sense and donâ€™t blame people who are just trying to do their jobs. We would rather be home with our families too.

Got my grocery order from Smart&Final today. I wiped everything with Lysol. I ordered more Lysol, there was none in stock. I got everything else. I almost got off of the Heineken wagon, came real close to ordering some. I quit because I noticed when I take my exercise walk I got tired when I was drinking beer. I had the shopper leave my bags at the door. I use rubber gloves to unpack and disinfected everything, washed the fruit in hot water and soap. After I unpack and disinfect I take the bags to the trash bin. I wash the gloves in hot water as though I'm washing my hands. Hope you guys are practicing social distancing.

Hello all, So my dad is 60 years old, so he's worried about the coronavirus. I understand his worry. But my brother just came back from the grocery store, and my father is wiping Lysol Bleach on the food packaging. This seems like a really really bad idea in terms of safety. He's only spraying a small amount on each item then wiping it off but it still doesn't seem safe To be clear, he isn't spraying it on open food, it's like cheese wrapped in plastic, or bags of chips, or glass drinks. But this still seems very unsafe. Can I get some help here, thank you.

Here in California they have someone with a whiteboard showing what is out of stock at the entrance so u donâ€™t waste time, Purell/Lysol wipes and some other cleaning stuff today and one per customer on a lot of items, no returns printed on some shelves
Here is a number that is also very important to me, I watch for it, the foreign. 49, or 409. The way my mind is coded from my #American education, this means cleanup, it means speak in Spanish, â€œspic & spanâ€, The mop and glow in the numbers racket. A wax on, wax off. Like Lysol. RT @philipaohlund: Chinese researchers have warned of a new mutated version ofÂ coronavirusÂ that could infect people for nearly two months. ðŸŒŸ
Here is my #WednesdayThoughts this #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown is starting to make people #cabinfever & I want to know #Coronavirustruth I donâ€™t know anybody Personally who has it! Is it a #PizzaGate #PedoGate cover up? #Lysol kills it ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
"Hey /r/bangtan,


The CDC Foundation has received an outpouring of donations from ARMY recently -- so much that they offered to create a team page! All contributions made under the name of BTS and/or ARMY can be seen in a special section, with the real-time total amount raised, and all the messages from our fellow ARMY. 

Each dollar is also being matched by a corporation (this time it's Lysol), so our donations go twice as far. 

&nbsp;

Currently the teamâ€™s total sits at around $28,000 USD total from over 500 donations.


**UPDATE** As of 4/3/20 4:30PM PST, the BTS ARMY team total sits at around $40,000 USD total from 759 donations.

**Donate with the BTS ARMY team page here: [[LINK]](https://give4cdcf.org/cdcf2020/BTSArmy)**

&nbsp;

For the past years, our subreddit has donated to various charities in the name of BTS. Just recently, we've raised $3,600 USD for COVID-19 relief funds through Hope Bridge, a South Korean organization focused on aiding those affected by unexpected disasters. **If you weren't able to participate, or would like to donate again, we encourage going through the CDC Foundation.**  We hope that those who are financially able and willing could contribute to COVID-19 relief efforts.

&nbsp;

**Again, here's the link for the CDC Foundation donations: [[LINK]](https://give4cdcf.org/cdcf2020/BTSArmy)**

&nbsp;

**EDIT**
&nbsp;

We wanted to clarify that the CDC Foundation is a separate non-profit from the CDC. They have a four star rating from the non-profit evaluator Charity Navigator which you can view [here](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10296)

Hey every single person in this comment section can suck my fucking dick, which judging by the way you all go about life would give me a litany of easily preventable diseases. If any of you have kids, they'd be better off sold to human traffickers. At least they'd have the vaccinations they need. This comment section reads like a high school reunion for everyone in America who was the oldest kid in their high school, and their greatest achievement was finding out Joe Rogan has a podcast. Scrolling down through these depressing dumb fucking responses has been so very illuminating, in the way a high powered police searchlight pointed straight up a man's gaping asshole shows every capillary and benign polyp. Whoever uploaded this video must be flabbergasted that even though they explain exactly why it says Coronavirus on the Lysol can, the comments still read like Richard Preston fanfiction. I wish we were far enough away in the future where I could pay comcast ten bucks to taze one of you through the internet. I hope when you're all up in the ICU with tubes running into your noses and planning your Nana's funerals, you can take a few days to maybe read a fucking book and get smart. You know, build some neural pathways in place of whatever post-apocalyptic wasteland you've got going on in your dipshit brain meats right now. How do you people flock to these videos? Is there like a biological algorithm that attracts you to come in here and say dumb shit or am l just talking to thirty idiots from an anti-vax facebook group that want to infect enough people so heaven has to issue a fuckin shelter-at-home order? I hope none of you motherfuckers get this thing because I dont think the responsibility of keeping it to yourself is anywhere close to your wheelhouse. And if we lose Florida... think we all know who to blame: OJ Simpson.
Hey guys, thank you so much for your support. However, we are temporarily out of stock of masks, Lysol and Clorox wipes, disinfectant sprays and hand sanitizers. We will let you know when our inventory levels replenish! #experiencethedifference #COVID19 #preparation
Hi Ladies, today's workouts were Yoga Basics and XT Burn Sets Bi's and Tri's. Week two of the new rotation and I already messed up! Thanks, Laurel for posting the rotation plan because it made me realize I and repeating week 1! My knee is doing a little better. I hope to feel better tomorrow so I can get a leg workout in. We had a rainy and damp day. I don't like these damp days. At least my bones didn't hurt much. The only bone that hurt was my left middle finger. It's been pretty windy since the late afternoon. The wind is so strong at times that I thought the windows were going to break. The temps will drop into the low 30's tonight! We've been having temps in the 60's at night! I decided to make a quick trip to the supermarket before the virus spreads like crazy. I am going to try to be at the supermarket by 7:30 tomorrow. I am going to use a bandana to cover my nose and mouth and will wear clear, protective goggles for my eyes. I also have latex gloves and will wear a pair of gloves. I will also take Lysol disinfectant wipes in a ziplock bag in case the supermarket doesn't have any. I heard someone stole the giant wipes tub from the supermarket! I heard that one of the local supermarkets has installed plastic shields to separate the cashiers from the customers. Walmart will be doing it but the supermarket I go to hasn't done it yet and we haven't heard they're planning to do it. My aunt told me that in Italy the cashiers wear face shields. My uncle had some kind of a crisis last night. My aunt was told that his kidneys weren't functioning well. She won't get another update until sometime tomorrow. I can't imagine the agony of having to wait 24 hours or more for the next condition update. Laurie, awesome workout! That is such a fun workout! I definitely need to take care of your knee. It took a while to get yours back to normal! I'm so glad your dd wears glasses. A fantastic idea to not wear your contacts for now! I heard someone recommend contact wearers to stop wearing them for now. Unfortunately, my uncle had that crisis last night. I hope we have better news tomorrow. Laurel, great workout combo! In the case of the coronavirus, no news is definitely good news! Thanks for posting the rotation plan because I wasn't thinking about what I was doing! I definitely like the idea of alternating the different programs. I hope my uncle is able to recover from the crisis he had last night. My poor aunt was very worried. The last time we went to the supermarket was on 3/16. I need to get some fresh produce, bread, eggs, milk, and meat. I read that the virus was spreading rapidly in AL and also about the Stay at Home order in VA! I think you can still go food shopping during a Stay at Home order. I've been ordering pantry staples from Amazon and Target so I don't waste time at the supermarket getting those things. Goodnight ladies! Thelma
Hot damn! RT @GarrettClif: The giant discount store chain, Costco, is now telling its customers that they cannot return overbought items purchased in bulk during the coronavirus outbreak. The top products that canny be returned are paper products, water and Lysol.
How about someone who has entered a room and just breathed and spoke for about 5 minutes? My neighbor fell yesterday and came over asking for help, she is elderly and my parents were roughly 3 to 4 feet away from her in a room. She stood only in the doorway and that doorway is basically entered into through the garage. As soon as she left out the garage after we told her we cannot help her and to leave (she surprised us and just walked in) we wiped down the whole door frame with Clorox wipes, sprayed lysol disinfectant all over the couch and carpeting she was near. This shit has me paranoid. Not only for us but also for her because her lungs are already messed up as it is. I know being 3 to 4 feet away wasn't ideal, I only happened upon the exchange because I heard my mom talking to someone and came to see her being told to leave and seek medical attention for her bruising from the fall. This is the only contact any of us has had with someone outside the home other than the instacart people who deliver our groceries(which we also wipe down fervently) and they leave them in the garage. To be honest, I really dont believe the neighbor is sick because her immune system is shit, so if she was exposed at any time in recent days, this virus would have put her in the hospital already. My mom called and checked on her today to see how she was feeling from the nasty fall and to ask her if she had any symptoms. So far so good. We are going to keep checking on her to see if she needs anything and to keep telling her to stay the fuck home.
How could he not know? I knew and I am not a Doctor, anyone is a potential carrier of the virus! Why wear a Mask and gloves of any kind. Carry Lysol and bleach wipes. Scrub your hands like a surgeon does, better red and raw than dead!! RT @Yamiche: The governor of Georgia says he just learned in the last 24 hrs that people without symptoms can spread coronavirus. Yet, for at least three weeks, day after day, WH officials & scientists have said on live TV for millions to watch that asymptomatic people can spread the virus.

I accepted a job with a company and theyâ€™re asking that I start on Monday...in the office. Anyone have extra face masks, sanitizer and/or Lysol wipes? #coronavirus I just want to #StayHome and be safe!
"I am an essential worker and my place of work is not prepared with anything to prevent the virus. No deep cleaning, no hand sanitizer, no clorox wipes, no lysol, nothing. 

I also had a coworker that was sick a week ago with a cough and fever and was gone for 5 days. He is ""better"" now but is back in the office. I do not know if he got tested or if he contacted his doctor or called the cdc or did anything to see if he could rule out COVID19. I believe he just went home to rest and came back to work when he was feeling better. We work in close quarters...I don't feel safe. 

Is there any number or website where I can anonymously contact someone about my work conditions? My bosses don't communicate anything with us either (I'm not sure if it's legal for them to share employee information?). Please advise. 

I am located in Florida."

I am in the same situation. Be extra careful, have a daily for when you get home. Have somebody waiting for you by the front door with a garbage bag. Strip into your underwear and put all the clothes into the bag. Leave your shoes outside if possible, and spray them with lysol or windex if available. Have somebody have some wipes ready for you too and wipe down anything you touch. Now, run to the shower and use hot water and lots of soap. Hope this helps you a little bit
I bequeath my gung fu to Humblegunner. Cool! I'll need to hose it down with Lysol first, no telling where you've been.
I bring my own now. I have a bag with clorox wipes, hand sanitizer and lysol spray and I bring it with me to stores now
I brought Lysol spray with me today. Hosed down the cart like three times.

I can't find any neoprene gloves or Lysol and these seem to be getting more scarce. How necessary are they? Are there alternatives or should I just wait?
"I do a lot of circuit board and electronic work as a side job (hobby work) to make some pocket change from the regular job.  I have a gallon or so of 99% isopropyl alcohol for cleaning electronics.  It'll be repurposed with paper towels if necessary.  Wife got a good supply of Lysol wipes so should be good for a month or so.  

This situation is going to get ugly.  Be prepared."
I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any other aerosol spray like this in the market? Febreeze isnâ€™t a disinfectant.
I donâ€™t think its just old Lysol sprays that say that. I have a Lysol can that says Corona virus and I purchased it a few months ago (before the outbreak).
I don't blame them at all. All the people that went crazy & bought $1000 worth of TP or a truckload of bleach & Lysol, should be forced to live with their decisions. You should not reward stupidity. Plus, that made it where a lot of regular folks couldn't get even 1 roll of TP. RT @GarrettClif: The giant discount store chain, Costco, is now telling its customers that they cannot return overbought items purchased in bulk during the coronavirus outbreak.

I don't have to spray my email with lysol, so its got that going for it.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but... Spraying strangers with Lysol is assault. ðŸ‘€ #COVIDãƒ¼19 #coronavirus #WednesdayWisdom #MaineDefender #YourMaineLawyer #PortlandMElaw
I feel foolish now that I followed the initial advice to buy supplies to spend â€œtwo weeks at home.â€ I luckily have a multi-pack of toilet paper, and a few rolls of paper towels, but canâ€™t find sanitizers (Clorox wipes, Lysol, even rubbing alcohol) anywhere with delivery or curbside pickup. My grocery says they are in stock, but they are never in my order once I pick it up. Anyone have any ideas for where an immunocompromised person can get some cleaning supplies? I usually buy non-toxic stuff, so Iâ€™m not sure it kills Covid-19. Should I just brave actually going in Target or Walgreens? I have friends on the look-out, but they are being careful too. This is all making me paranoid. Iâ€™m in the US if that helps.
I flew a week and a half ago. I can tell you that I felt like delta really stepped up their game on sanitation. Half of my plane was empty and we were all spread out. I took a lot of vitamins before and during my flight. I had a mask and gloves. I wiped my seat with Lysol wipes including the tray. I also sanitized my neighbors seat.
I found a generic can of aerosol disinfectant under the bathroom sink and felt like Gollum finding the ring. #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown RT @VisionBored1: Just found an ancient can of Lysol spray and it was just like finding money in an old coat pocket
I found some old Lysol cans in the shed - perhaps from the 2009 Sars thing. I noticed they are 79% ethanol. The new ones are 58% along with .10% of some long name (Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium saccharinate). I think that last one is the same stuff on Clorox wipes and 409.
I got hand sanitizer on staples.com of all places this morning. Still havent been able to find Lysol spray anywhere though. Think I might try home depot first thing in the AM tomorrow. I'll report back if i have any luck.
I gotta say, while this is clearly the greatest thing ever made, I am concerned with their frankly cavalier use of Lysol spray which is only slightly less valuable than 24K gold at the moment... RT @PhilNobileJr: And why in Godâ€™s name would you attempt to create any kind of coronavirus-related entertainment after this? Itâ€™s all been done; pack up your Final Draft, Cody.
I had a friend tell me the other day that he spent 20 minutes wiping down all of his groceries with Lysol wipes and I was like â€œIs...is that what weâ€™re supposed to be doing?â€
I has been using lysol spray on the cases after everyone left and when I told my super we needed more he told me don't use it for that it uses it too fast. Im just thinking "there's a global pandemic and you're going to tell me don't use so much disinfectant spray instead of ok you'll get more. "
"I have a very limited supply of surgical masks (I know they aren't as good as n95, but they are better than nothing for self protection.)

I know they say alcohol can damage a masks effectiveness, but does anyone out there know about lysol spray? Would a three second coating of lysol damage it as badly as alcohol or should I use boiling water vapor every time?

Seeing if anyone else has done this"
I have already gotten the â€œwhat happened to my hands?â€ phone call from my motherâ€™s friend, who used bleach and then Lysol. RT @TimHerrera: Disinfecting our homes has become a national pastime â€” but misusing those cleaning products can be dangerous and even deadly.

I haven't been able to find lysol disinfectant spray for the last 3 and a half weeks or toilet paper, and this is why. My folks are older and hoarders who purchase and resale like this should be reported. Lol they offered financing, disgusting. #COVID19 #eBay #COVID19Pandemic
I haven't posted in here before, but I've been reading the posts for the last week or so, and am not sure where else to express this concern. I have a really sore throat. No other symptoms, but it's raw feeling. I'm not coughing. I have some nasal congestion. I have allergies, but pollen is not high here. Maybe my mold/dust allergies are acting up, but sore throat isn't a usual allergy symptom. My husband and I live alone, we haven't been out of the house since 3/14. We have gotten lots of Amazon packages, and a grocery delivery but I've taken every precaution I could think of. (Left packages outside for days, spray them with lysol and let them wait in the garage for more days, wipe all the groceries with wipes, wear gloves, remove clothes after, shower.) Guess I will see what tomorrow brings. I am so tired of being so scared.
I heard a report on the news of a lady who sprayed her face with Lysol after grocery shopping and had to go to the ER. Ironic her precautions lead her to the ER before the virus. Iâ€™ve also heard of people cleaning their groceries upon arriving home. Talk about overkill.
I hit the COVID-19 Jackpot! I got All Purpose flour, toilet paper AND one container of Lysol wipes today when my groceries were delivered! I've had all of those items in my weekly normal shopping order for the past 3 weeks but none were available. Today was my lucky day! #COVID19
I just spent 15 minutes going in circles in my house, trying to remember why I pulled out one of my few remaining Lysol Disinfecting Wipes. And the dual action, no less #coronavirus
I just sprayed down a lysol wipe container with lysol. #COVID19 #ChineseVirus
I just want to know why the Clorox and Lysol products are?? Do you have them in the warehouse?? Amazon is definitely not doing a good job keeping inventory. All that other stuff you wrote is an excuse for a billionaire. Just tell us where the disinfectant is. Thatâ€™s more helpful!!
I just wanted to say thank you to the Walmart in Franklin Indiana. Iâ€™m a manager at a doctors office and we are doing curbside sick visits and covid-19 testing and canâ€™t find Lysol spray anywhere. I called Walmart and they were able to hold 6 cans for us. We appreciate it so much.
I just wash my hands as soon as I get in the door. Then Lysol/bleach doorknobs.
I just watched a seven minute video on how to clean your groceries of Covid19... I understand precautions but Jesus Christ I'm not going to Lysol my chip bagðŸ˜‚ or leave my groceries outside my door for three days???
I just went to get some groceries yesterday, no toilet paper/paper towels/napkins/dish soap/Lysol. Tons of potatoes, no noodles and very low rice. Milk full stocked, but no flour or baking soda.
I just went to Loweâ€™s today to get some supplies and was really impressed with some of the things I saw: disinfected carts in separate area to choose from, a plexi glass wall in front of each cash register to separate customer from cashier and keep any sneezes or coughs from spreading, painted areas in line 6 ft apart that say â€œwait hereâ€ to separate customers from eachother, as as soon as EACH customer leaves they wipe down the debit card machine and counter with Lysol wipes. BIG LOWES FAN RIGHT HERE!!
I just went today at 1 pm and it was a ghost town. Madison wi. They had everything but lysol wipes and sanitizer.
"I keep a split, glove activities, ungloved activities.

Gloves go on before I get out of the car. Anything I touch gloved (grocery bags, money, credit card) gets disinfected before touching it ungloved. When I get back to my car, I take off my gloves *after* I open the exterior door but before touching the interior, so my interior is as sanitized as my house is and is just cleaned thoroughly with regular car cleaners (thank god, because Lysol and hand sanitizer fucking destroy car interiors. Hand sanitizer can straight up melt the coatings on cheap leather).

Groceries and such are disinfected at the door, jacket shoes and pants stay by the door for ~3 days before leaving the foyer.

Obviously I canâ€™t test this via cultures, but as far as setting up a containment procedure itâ€™s pretty sound logically. Itâ€™s the same way you do containment for clean rooms

Edit: the viral load from picking it up off a surface and depositing it on another surface is going to also be lower than the load an infected person leaves behind by touching the surface. Each transfer is <100% obviously, so it should decay exponentially with each successive transfer"
I know someone who owns 12 rental properties and CIBC gave him a mortgage deferral on all of them. Don't believe what they say about people who own investment properties, these supply hoarders are the housing equivalent of those that bought all the hand sanitizer and lysol wipes to resell.
I know that these are trying times for studios/producers/etc. and that they're doing their best to find innovative ways to get their movies released and claw back some level of profit. But holy shit charging 19.99 to rent a movie for 48 hours should be illegal. That's almost as price gouged as toilet paper and Lysol...
i may not be able to smell or taste right now..but if i NEVER have to smell lysol again..iâ€™d be ok with that.. #NurseTwitter #COVID19 #NursesWhoTweet
I need a bottle of Lysol. Where the hell can I find some?

I normally like to follow the news for these type of news stories. When Ebola was big in the news I was following the articles from Day 1. When I started seeing news stories about a new virus hitting a meat market in China. I found it interesting so I decided to follow it on a whim. And then 15+ cities in China went on full or partial quarantines. It made me think it could go worldwide at the scale it was hitting but I wasnâ€™t sure until one day at work I noticed people buying more cleaning supplies than normal. Then my supervisor told me that a company wide email went out that there was going to shortages for Lysol products, hand sanitizer, and similar products. I kind of went into overdrive and had my boyfriend go buy cleaning products. My boyfriend thought I was being a little crazy but indulged me to give me a better peace of mind. Especially since me and him both know heâ€™s in the at risk category. He no longer thinks Iâ€™m crazy once the bottled water went on buying limits and the grocery store shelves are now heavily picked through. He had me buy a 20 pound bag of rice.
I paid the irrigation guy today to fix my sprinkler system at my home. He requested cash. ðŸ’µ So I said ok but you know cash carries a lot of germs ðŸ¦  & in this day with #COVID19 around itâ€™s risky! ðŸ¤” He said.. Yes! Can you clean it first? I said ok!ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½Lysol & Ziplock Ok? Yes.
I read on the CDC website that in order to properly disinfect against covid 19, the spray or wipe must be in contact for at least 10 mins. that's why I think alcohol is better to wipe stuff with.
I saw a repost of a "look Lysol in 2018 kills human coronavirus so this thing is a hoax" meme.
I set the record straight on when the #China #coronavirus was 1st tweeted and by whom - respected open source intelligence accounts and had the most extraordinary experience washing my dishes and cleaning my kitchen with Lysol thanks to @elderofziyon
I sprayed my cereal boxes with lysol! Once I get an Amazon package, I immediately open it and then get rid of the box. I wash my heads and then disinfect whatever surface it touched. ðŸ¦  RT @Flirtyflipper: Have you been spraying down your Amazon packages with Lysol? I have not but I know a few people who have. #COVID19Pandemic #coronavirus
I tend to spray with a bleach-water mix, wipe it down, then spray it with lysol and leave it. First spray and wipe gets the more physical stuff that you might actually see, the 2nd spray sits and kills off whatevers left that you dont see. I'd still do the same thing if all i had was lysol. Looking at the can, lysol says it kills the SARS-corona virus in 30 seconds, to disinfect it says surfaces remain wet for 3 min, then allow to air dry. It generally stays wet long enough by itself w/o going crazy with it. Bleach wipe with a lysol follow up, imo, i feel pretty confident its clean.
I think you'd be hard pressed to find one right now. Especially since I just walked out of Costco and they can't keep toilet paper, paper towels or even Lysol stocked. YouTube some homemade mask options. Sent from my SM-G975U using Tapatalk
i told my mom iâ€™m gonna call the psych ward on her if she doesnâ€™t stfu about this whole coronavirus. i canâ€™t even go outside without being screamed at to take a box of gloves and lysol wipes with me!!!!!!!!!!!!
I use vinegar/water for most of my cleaning and have maintained my normal routine. I saw a crazy story about a waitress who was dipping her tip bills in lysol. Cancer anyone?
I walked by my neighbor today and he was spraying his keys on the floor with Lysol.
I was asked if it was ok to spray lysol on a mask then put it on before going out? SERIOUSLY? What do you say " yeah sure go for it." #Coronavirus #WeirdWednesday
I was at the target in Fenway a few days ago and they had quite a few generic brand wipes. I checked and they do say they kill 99.9% of germs, same as Lysol although they do have limits on how many customers can buy.
I was buying cheese at Target and watched some teenage girl pick up and touch like every single pack of Sargento to look at all the labels. Lysol your packages people.
I watched a woman fix her whole outfit this morning and then adjust her mask and I just cringed. Am I the only person that walks like a zombie to keep my hands away from my body! If you even just adjust your clothes that makes you more at risk. I bring wipes to wipe down all my food items then Lysol before I put in my car, bring hand sanitizer, donâ€™t touch my phone etc. and people are still out here standing in the middle of the goddamn aisles having conversations.
I went shopping for the first time in a month. I wasnâ€™t sure what it was going to be like. It was hard to find certain beans, yeast, potstickers and Lysol. Not bad overall, I wasnâ€™t willing to try more than one store.
I went to the laundromat today. Wore a mask and gloves. Brought Lysol wipes for everything I touched and sat on. Also brought a SHOUT spray bottle for the skids in my shorts. #bobinthecity #coronavirus
I went today around 4pm and there was no line to get in. It was as busy as a pre-coronavirus weekday evening. Lines moving very quickly. There is a lot of stock. Missing the usual items, including Lysol wipes, flour. But rice was back in stock (seems like people have had a hard time finding it), and there was plenty of meat and dairy. Theyâ€™ve got people walking around constantly restocking and sanitizing. They are still counting people at the front door, so there maybe a line if it gets busy again.
I wondered how long it would take for there to be enough local #COVID19 cases to make me paranoid enough to start gloving up and Lysolâ€™ing groceries before bringing them in. April 1st was the answer.
I work at an Ama FC. While some steps are being taken, theyâ€™re clearly just to protect the company from getting sued, not to protect the workers. We are getting a TON of new hires to keep up with demand, since we are selling everything not just essentials. Itâ€™s impossible to stay 6ft apart from each other in a crowded warehouse, where palettes are 3ft apart, while ALSO keeping our rates up (we get written up if we are too slow), although corporate is pressuring managers to write up for this. We have Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer, but no other PPE (other than standard work gloves). There is no way to avoid spread at Ama.
I worked at a hardware store, and the masks, hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol and Lysol disappeared in February. The supply chain and warehouse did not have any more of most of it, as if it did not make it from factory to warehouse, even though there are normally regular deliveries. Itâ€™s as if someone told the factories to divert a lot of crucial stuff to the black market.
Iâ€™ll take them over commercials for toilet paper, flushable wipes, Lysol disinfectant, cruise lines, doing business in Abu Dhabi, and Sandals Resorts â€” all of which I still see on the air.  All those things are about as relevant to me now as the ads for large accounting, aviation, and engineering firms that air on Sunday morning pundit shows.  Buying a roll of Charmin is now as much in my reach as the Gulfstream jets they advertise on Meet the Press.
Iâ€™m just saying if coronavirus doesnâ€™t kill me. The amount of Lysol and bleach fumes Iâ€™m inhaled probably will.
Iâ€™m lighting the bar signal for @Lysol This #Coronavirus need to go #itsover #imoverit #begone #viruswho
Iâ€™ve been seeing some ads about people seeing coronavirus on your Lysol and other products before the virus CoVID-19 came out and I wanted to clear that up. The coronavirus has been around for a long time it is responsible for the typical common cold in most cases.
Iâ€™ve stopped writing regularly in this space. But given the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in, I thought it might be a good idea to document for posterity (hopefully!) life during a global pandemic. 5:30 AM â€“ I wake up and get dressed. I pair a nice turtleneck and blazer with sweatpants, as I canâ€™t deal with jeans right now. I make an espresso from the little machine my husband (thankfully!) gave me last year on my birthday.Â  I feed Sally and take her outside, then go downstairs to begin my work day. 6:00 AM â€“ I co-own my own PR agency, which was launched three years ago. One of our clients has a big announcement today, which we are trying to get reporters to write about. Most outlets are covering COVID-19 almost exclusively, so it has been difficult to break through. I pitch my guts out, flagging stories as they appear. We are lucky enough to have a good result. We have to get reporters to update any inaccuracies that might be in a story, which is stressful. Launches are stressful. We have had three in the past week alone, which means I have had two weeks so far of 12 hour days. 7:30 AM â€“ I make breakfast (frozen waffles) for the twins and make sure they are dressed and awake for their 8:00 AM Zoom meeting with their class. 8:00 AM â€“ Back to media pitching for the next hour. We end up with 5 stories, which is largely a result of great teamwork by our account team of three people. 9:00 AM â€“ I begin to prep for my 10 AM meeting, preparing a client agenda and updatingÂ  our weekly status report. 10:00 AM â€“ Client call. We talk about the business outlook for the last few minutes, but no one really knows what is going to happen to the enterprise tech industry.Â  This feels unnerving, but weâ€™re lucky we arenâ€™t being hit like the travel, hospitality and retail sectors. 10:30 AM â€“ I take a break and fix myself half a bagel, cream cheese and lox. My husband ordered a kit of bagels, lox, sable and cream cheese from Russ t say enough about our school. The teachers have hustled like I canâ€™t believe, and are conducting classes almost like normal, with a few exceptions. Iâ€™ve written to the principal and advisors to express my thanks, because the dedication honestly brings me to tears. 11:00 AM â€“ Back to the grindstone. Itâ€™s nice to have one happy client, but we have six others that also have various needs. We also have five freelancers to pay every month in addition to ourselves, and there is accounting administration I need to handle. The bookkeeping function is my least favorite part of being a business owner. 12:00 PM â€“ Our Instacart order of groceries has arrived, via a heroic delivery person! Ordering groceries has been like trying to get concert tickets to see a particularly popular band. My husband had been constantly refreshing order pages with multiple tabs open for different grocery services, until he finally got this Instacart deliveryâ€“which took over a week to obtain and confirm. Before this delivery, we were subsisting on Russ we wipe down every package with a lysol wipe, and leave the packaging on the front step outside as coronavirus germs can live on packaging for 24 hours. Itâ€™s crazy how obtaining, unloading and maintaining a food supply for four people feels like it is now a matter of life or death. 12:30 PM â€“ I need to prep for another meeting in one hour. This will be a Zoom call so I brush my hair and make sure I have on a necklace and look presentable. The wifi has been sputtering and slowing, which is a big concern. Weâ€™ve heard about people getting fired from remote work because their wifi isnâ€™t good enough. 1:00 PM â€“ Zoom call goes fine, I guess. I have to move to the kitchen where the wifi is better, and there is a lot of ambient noise from Sally and the kids. It isnâ€™t ideal as I am leading the call and talking a lot. 2:00 PM â€“ I clean the kitchen, empty and load the dishwasher and do a load of laundry. Itâ€™s crazy how many dishes are generated just by everyone being home. After this I allow myself for the first time to check the coronavirus reddit news stream. Chris Cuomo has the virus, which sucks. His banter with his brother Andrew Cuomoâ€“about which son their mom likes betterâ€“has been a rare ray of sunshine in a grim sky. UGH. Iâ€™m worried about my friend who works in healthcare, a client who may have the virus, our freelancer who lives in Hoboken and many others. Checking on the news aggravates these fears. 3:00 PM â€“ The kids have wrapped school and itâ€™s time for our favorite activity in this new worldâ€“walking our dog. A few words about Sally. We decided to adopt a dog last year, after a lot of begging and pleading from the twins. I spent months researching what kind of dog would be right for our family. I didnâ€™t want a pet that required a lot of walks (which in retrospect might not have been the right decision?), I didnâ€™t want a puppy because I donâ€™t have time to spend on training and sleep is critical to my life. I wanted a breed that was sweet and kind, not very energetic and most importantlyâ€“we wanted a dog who would be a loving family member. In one of the online quizzes I took to match our family with a breed, the English Bulldog was suggested and a memory was activated. When I was on cheer squad, our high school had a real bulldog â€œmascot,â€ proudly managed by a town citizen who was the official owner. This arrangement was kind of like Frank W. Seiler and his long line of â€œUgaâ€ bulldogs, but on a much smaller scale. As someone who spent lots of time on the sidelines of the games, I got to hang out with the dog quite a bit. He was a total ham who loved people and especially kids, and he had a very sweet disposition. I quickly found the closest bulldog rescue, spotted Sally (who had a different name) and after passing a rather rigorous background process, we drove two hours to pick her up. Sally is OBSESSED with food and you canâ€™t leave anything around unsupervised. A week ago, she nabbed a freshly baked precious loaf of banana bread off the counter, and swallowed it whole in about one second. She also suffers from skincare and eye issues we need to manage daily. But overall, adopting Sally has been the best thing weâ€™ve done in years. She is our family mascot, during this tough time. Her funny face is reminiscent of Winston Churchill, and she cheers us up. 3:45 PM â€“ Our walk concludes. It is strange to walk the neighborhood yet stay away from people and not see any cars. The atmosphere is eerie and weird. But getting outside is helpful. As is talking to the kids and my husband. 4:00 pm â€“ After a quick break to drink water and eat a snack (everything is so carb-y and my salad days are over) I go back to conclude a few reports that are due as well as a writing project for a client. 6:30 pm â€“ I wrap my work for the day. While my husband prepares dinner (leftover homemade minestrone soup, rye bread from Russ t big drinkers so we have lots of supplies left over from that fad. I make us a â€œfancy whiskeyâ€ as we have the ingredients (which are dwindling). We have a lovely family dinner. My daughter, so similar to her cheerleader mother, proposes a family spirit week. We choose themes for each day next week, and we vow to dress for each one. 7:00 pm â€“ We watch CNN and hear from Chris Cuomo about what itâ€™s like being diagnosed with coronavirus. He doesnâ€™t look great, or maybe itâ€™s my imagination. He gives an uplifting speech about how we all need to join together, and I cry. He feels like a member of my family, strangely, in his basement camera away from his family. 8:00 pm â€“ Every area builds community differently. In my hometown, we have started to howl like coyotes at 8:00 PM to express our gratitude for the healthcare providers on the front lines and the grocery workers feeding us. We all go onto our porch and howl, and Sally joins in. Itâ€™s a silly moment of release, and it makes me feel better. 8:15 pm â€“ I watch â€œUnorthodoxâ€ on Netflixâ€“a Hasidic Brooklyn woman flees her marriage for Berlin, a strange and intriguing plot. I canâ€™t help but stare hungrily at the screen as it depicts a â€œnormalâ€ bustling urban life full of crowds, which is now so very far from normal. I miss meeting my friends for coffee, going to meetings to see my clients and I miss the â€œnormalâ€ life we enjoyed so recently. But, I buck up. This is our moment to be strong and tough. This isnâ€™t some dystopian novel Iâ€™m reading for a book club. We are in this moment, and this is our time to rise to the challenge. I need to act like those tough Londoners did during the Blitz. When our football team was losing in high school (which was often), I chose optimism over despair and screamed my head off on the sideline. I try to do the same now, for our doctors and nurses, drivers and delivery people, for our kids and for our parents. All we can do is hope for the best. Xoxo, Jjiraffe Stay safe and stay well.
Idahoan here and the main theory going around here is that it's a ploy by the government to use martial law to enslave the American people, and as proof...a lysol can... see they say, it says kills "corona virus". This virus has been around a long time they are just using now to take control ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸
if I dont want coronavirus while still wearing a beat, should I use lysol disinfectant as setting spray for my makeup? ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ˆðŸ¼ #WOWhelpme
If I see one more video of people showing that Coronavirus is listed on old Lysol canisters and relaying that to a conspiracy theory, I'm going to kill a kitten. Coronavirus was discovered in the 1960s. What we're experiencing now is an evolved strain. Stop being stupid.
If she cares about Covid-19 so much, why is she putting her family at risk by giving them crap food that weakens the immune system? Tell her that no amount of Lysol spraying is going to make up for the damage she's doing to the family's health.
If somebody dropped an album & included a can of @Lysol with purchase rn theyâ€™d go platinum smh #coronavirus
If the virus is aerosolized, and there is evidence it is, sanitizing hard surfaces won't be enough. If she gets sick and is traipsing in and out of shared spaces, you're going to get sick, too, 6' of distance and lysol between you or not.
If they insist on coming in wear a mask and have wipes- follow them and wipe everything- make them feel really uncomfortable spray lysol generously too.
If you honestly thought we could trust any number coming out of China, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. Youâ€™ll need a shit ton of Lysol wipes, though. US intelligence community finds China concealed the extent of its COVID-19 outbreak. https://twitter.com/i/events/1245386755513053184
If you wear a mask sprayed with Lysol I don't think the coronavirus can penetrate it
If you were to ask me the exponential growth of Covid 19 for the country or the number of Active cases currently... I wouldn't have an answer ready. But if you were to ask me the amount of lizol needed per bucket of water... That I can tell you ðŸ¤”
Keep Lysol at front door. Spray bottom of shoes before entry. Vacuuming blows virus into air. Outside....watch wind direction coming from major cities. Mainly by night. During day UV light kills virus.
Well, now we now that 3M was selling PPE overseas to the highest bidder instead of the US. https://youtu.be/YsmKvC7RpEQ I guess this is why we cant find toilet paper and Lysol. Shame on these companies. Traitors!
Also if you can't get disinfectant wipes use a rag and bring your own Lysol or similar product, try to find a small pocket sized spray bottle. Spray the rag and wipe down your cart. Hold on to the rag with gloves or without gloves, use the rag to; pick up products you want to read the nutritional info, open doors, turn on taps and even to open your car door and wipe down your steering wheel and any other place that gets touched, simply hang onto that rag and keep spraying it with your little bottle of disinfectant spray. Wash hands thoroughly when you get home, wipe down door knob and door bell at home and any keys and any other place where any guests have touched. Peace be with you.
I have been talking back and forth with this guy for a month or 2 and FINALLY able to meet. Of course it had to be during a PANDEMIC. I made sure i was careful and let the product sit in my garage for 4 days. I then wiped them down with Lysol wipes. I hope everybody is being safe out there.

Ohio is just a stay at home state...I still have to go to work and make essential gun brushes?? Mmmkay...and now we have to limit the use of sanitizer and Lysol...and no temperatures are being taken..so how is it possible for us who have no choice but to work stay safe!
Rollin on the River What Lysol? ðŸ˜†
Spray with Lysol especially bottoms before entering your vehicles and homes. Spray again before storing. Where ever your hands go so do your feet. As droplets fall to the ground they are picked up on the soles of your shoes â€¦ continued spreading every step you take. will live for days on the floor of your vehicle so as soon as you step in and turn the heat or air on you blow that virus right in your face and up your nose.
Old people in the morning clean out the cleaning aisle and take all the lysol and disinfectants for their own family and friends. -.-
It's still stupid and ignorant ppl who aren't taking this seriously. Today at a store, I saw 2 ppl hugging tightly together bc they haven't seen each other for a long time. They were loud and proud about it. Same day, same store: one guy explaining to his friend how the staff at a cruise ship that he was on, sprayed down the ship with "lysol". In my mind, I'm like..."shouldn't you be somewhere in a caved mountain?" It's bc ppl like these the virus will have longevity. (So damn mad). We really should have a national shut down and other restrictions in place like china did. These are unprecedented times, and we don't have time for sheeps and ignorant ppl. #WeGotOneChance
M Mencia understand the difference between sorrow and fear. For me itâ€™s about doing my personal best (bleach/water mixed wiping cupboard knobs, doorknobs, surfaces...washing hands for 20+ secs, etc , spraying fabrics with Lysol, using rubber gloves and hopeful I can learn how to hand stitch a face mask...or many ). But fate? Thatâ€™s non of my business. My business is the present. Everyone has a tag but Iâ€™m here right now. My JOB is to stay high for those who canâ€™t ...because I could be a link to a greater whole...and by doing my personal best it might help the whole. So Iâ€™m grieving, mourning, wiping things and playing music as I go...anti war songs, George Winston (to be calm), soul music, anything to help the spirit inside move...with movement I have hope. With hope I have everything. Iâ€™m down to a small part now...thatâ€™s the suffering before I go. Thatâ€™s what I havenâ€™t dealt with ...yet. ðŸ˜”
@Melanie Martin you dont have to do anything you dont want to.go on ei then get another job...and yes liqour stores are an essential service you work in the industry educate yourself ...you cut off an alcholics supply were talking no detox avaisble....seisures...crime...drinking lysol...death.....surley you know this???!!!
And just where are we supposed to get masks from??? I canâ€™t find any anywhere! And I am scared! Also I see every country trying to disinfect and so far I havenâ€™t seen it here anywhere! Also where can I get masks from? I canâ€™t even find Lysol or disinfecting wipes because all the hoarding!
Brian Peck most all essentials are working without masks. Lysol spray. Or Clorox wipes. How will this virus ever stop spreading
TX Warrior Bride : Coronavirus is a blanket term for 12 different viruses including SARS and MERS. You probably read it on a Lysol bottle and thought they knew it was coming too. With all do respect, I canâ€™t believe there are so many people incapable of believing reality. Is it a coping mechanism?? Maybe. But my God, what a horrible mental prison to live in.
If you see on the Lysol wipes and spray and all that it says it disinfects for the corona virus so you know they have known about it for years
What If? The common cold it is a coronavirus I also think they said the flu is a coronavirus so the Lysol cans disinfected those guys but there's no strain they canâ€™t disinfect the new strain
I was reading on the Lysol spray disinfectant bottle that can kill even a human Coronavirus! So itâ€™s really not a new virus! and politician and doctors donâ€™t know about!? Something itâ€™s going on in this world ðŸŒ I feel bad for all the people that lost their lives! So Animal have vaccines against Coronavirus and for humans still cant find a cure! ðŸ˜¤
You're in Florida and those damn pythons are rocking Florida. This is NYC and there's nothing on the shelvez. No bleach, no Lysol products and if you forget something you're screwed. Nice carðŸ‘ Dunno how you do down there but if outside up here, people wear masks and gloves. At least think of wearing masks in public. These iguanas are mean! Wow thanks so much for the share. Self containment sucks! People here love these guts for pets but I don't think they are these guys - Mexican Spiny Tails. Oh man, hope we don't see them up here! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… poor dude looks like he's going to jail. What happened? Did you blow his head off Why not chop it off? Just curious don't know - May I have his skin? PLEASE I'll give you my mailing addy and pay shipping. Serious offer. I want it for patches on my $300 jeans - serious offer, Chef. Maybe you hve email ! Thank you for your videos and great presentations!ðŸ‘ðŸŽ¯ðŸ˜…

Thank you again for this life saving content.....yes, it is that valuable. A few things I would add. Using Lysol: -I'm using it as you do, BUT....take breaks. This is necessary if you get a LOT of groceries(5bags worth). I found that it's pretty harsh over a period of time, and the vapors really start getting to me. It's best to clean with windows open if possible. It recommends little or no skin contact. Gloves are recommended. I'm using regular dish gloves. Rags: I heard that you should get a fresh towel after a few items, instead of using the same one for everything. Would like to get confirmation on this. Wiping items after sanitizing: The Lysol bottles state you are to wipe off the surfaces you cleaned after for a period of up to 2min. I haven't done this after two deliveries. Does everyone wipe off after cleaning?? Vegetable washing: I saw a video with someone saying NOT to wash with soap, as some veggies are porous and can absorb. Instead they use a mixture of baking soda and water to wash off veggies.
They can open so many jobs for them like make PPE, mask, Lysol and ventilators! Itâ€™s too late now but itâ€™s good for another pandemic!!
Man show me some patients on their death beds, or the ones that's critically fighting for their lives. Bc mfs die everyday. How do I know they aren't ruling heart attacks, cancer, diabetic patients, etc as these corona virus patients. Ppl get shot, robbed, beat up, raped everyday here in Oakland California And when the newcast covers the incident they show the victim and the suspect. They go into grave detail on the situation, even when it's gruesome. Put on a hazmat suit, equip a GoPro on it and show me something worth believing please. I'm tired of ppl acting like they haven't been dirty filthy trash all these years. I've witnessed someone laying in a bed of molded food and roaches, you telling me Lysol wipes gonna stop the spread if there is one lol. Ppl in America have been not washing hands after restroom breaks, sneezing and coughing in hands for quite some time now be real lol
Do your part to flatten the curve! Iâ€™m here with my #Lysol. #chocolatelab #labradorretriever #lab #labrador #chocolate #browndog #diabetes #diabetic #florida #palmbeach #blacklab #yellowlab #chocolatelabsofinstagram #cataracts #chocolatelabsofinsta #puppy #COVID19 #Coronavirus
Gov. Cuomo, you are absolutely amazing! your compassion, strength, and fortitude know no bounds. Is it possible for the President to mandate that everyone in every state wear a mask when out in public? We can make our own masks without sewing. We can even wash them in Lysol or bleach. People are using bras to make N95 type masks. Listen, folks. Everyone should wear a mask to protect each other. If this becomes mandatory it will go a long way to prevent deaths. Masks can be made without sewing. A child can make these masks. A colored cloth can be washed with soap, water, and Lysol. A white cloth can be washed in soap, water, and bleach. Check out this link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbRsb0T7Oz8
Been keeping Lysol spray in our vehicle. We park near shopping carts to spray one well, especially the handles. (We Lysol spray the bottoms of our shoes before we go inside our house.) Also popping a zinc lozenge in our mouths right before going into a store. It's supposed to destroy viruses in nose and throat. (Nothing is foolproof.) The good doctor means well, but I find this impossible when there's little disinfectant spray available. We're just washing milk bottles and alike in soapy water in the sink for at least 1 minute, and of course washing fresh fruits and veggies, etc.
I reposted this. . . As a joke Everyone was reposting as legit. What the fuck is wrong with you???? Everyone yells "alkaline" and it isn't because the are knowledgeable. It is because they are BASIC as fuck. . . They want to be, metaphorically and literally but they don't understand. Oh drink hydrogen peroxide. . . . Oh yeah???? Drink bleach.. . . That kills both the fucking pieces of shit roaming the earth (yeah I'm talking about you if you think that's a good idea) Lysol killed Corona since Lysol was invented. Yeah????? Well drink that too! Why hasn't a vaccine been invented and Lysol had? Because Lysol kills fucking everything. You don't believe me? Try it. . . . Drink some. You'll be Corona free. "They want to inject me with the virus????" Do you know how a vaccines work? They work exactly like that. They inject you with a similar virus so your body can create antibodies against the pathogen's antigens. Fuck me in the ass side ways six times, please!!!!! My IQ goes down every time I scroll down my phone. I'm scared and not for a virus but for fucking humans as a whole.
Laura Cartier my plan is a giant hand sanitizer a giant Lysol and a giant soap that be the only way to stop COVID-19
My plan is to disinfect the whole planet giant everything Lysol hand sanitizer and soap that is what the virus is afraid of if we all work together we could be unstoppable Will be saving 1 billion livesðŸ™‚
They have a corona virus patent & a cure patent too. B@stards must have threatened Lysol, none can be found. ðŸ¤¬
Can people send this to that idiot Jeffree Star? He literally did a video where he had someone lysol spray his metal straw and open can of Red Bull, then lysol sprayed a french fry (probably didnâ€™t actually eat it). This is a dude that has millions of young followers that donâ€™t even know better.
This guy is now famous and Lysol is rich
Dr. Thank you very much for your helpfull videos. I have 3 questions please: 1. Do I need to desinfect the floors as well when I'm returning from the store (considering that I left my dirty shoes out)?. Does the virus fall from the clothes or bags? 2. I live in Bolivia and I cannot find Lysol, can I desinfect bags of food with 70% alcohol? 3. I leave in an apartment so I hace to bring everything inside and I don't have much space. Can I just leave my bags on the kitchen floor and just not walk near it? Thank you very much!!! God bless you.
Oh yeah well we can get Lysol wipes or masks on the outside. Stores are sold out so join the club, inmate
You can use SOAP to disinfect. Why do doctors use soap to clean their hands? The alkali in soap breaks down the cell wall of viruses & bacteria. Even if you canâ€™t get chlorine or chemical disinfectants, use soap. Hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, shampoo. I use a mixture of dish soap, vinegar & water to clean almost everything in my house. I save the boogie wipes & Lysol for my car.
Thank you Sir for your frontline icu work and valuble covid19 information.... Is lysol spray effective in quarintine... And antibiotics???????
well tell the homies to stick some lysol wipes up their ass with some more cell phones lmaoooo
Sooo why the question never came up if we sprayed a disinfectant on the mask then let it dry out be best? Also if itâ€™s ok with having a fog machine with Lysol and water mixed as home air disinfectant?
Have to have skies cleared for USAF to use crop dusters to spray lysol
When it comes to Lysol wipes.. if I canâ€™t to clean a bottle or a product that might have been touched by many people, how long do you have to wipe the product? When it comes to product like purrel, is it the same 20 seconds as soap.. since it dries off due to the alcohol fairly quickly?

You could wear one mask now. Save 5-30 mask for the workers that would care for you. I have one 95 I put in a zip lock and spray with Lysol between uses. Iâ€™ve only gone out 3 times in 3!weeks for groceries. Note: I ordered my 95 back in early Dec when I saw this starting in China.
I found this info on the Lysol website think it should answer any questions you have if Lysol will kill the Corona virus https://www.lysol.com/healthy-home/understanding-coronavirus/
I found out one of my neighbors got COVID-19 (they traveled for work a lot) IM BOUT TO LYSOL THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

@Chris B Yeah actually this Strain of Coroma Virus is Called SARS-2 and if You Guys LOOK ON THE DISEASES KILLED by LYSOL on the BACK of SPRAY CAN RIGHT NOW in YOUR HOUSE YOU'LL SEE ALL THE OTHER DISEASES in the PAST THAT HAVE AFFECTED the WORLD SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

I was using a mask today when I went out to my sister's home that also very hygienic and wore a cap and took my next door neighbour who is much younger and after that I bought Dettol and Lizol and industrial Gloves on working or washing as well. And I use my other bike Gloves so that if I touch any handle door or gate for protection.

Lysol been killing Coronavirus since the 60s
Iâ€™ve woken up with concerns of #COVID19 daily. I read the symptoms list daily and I â€˜haveâ€™ a new symptom everyday. I donâ€™t have a new symptom everyday. Or do I? I canâ€™t tell. Iâ€™m tired of the news notifications on my phone. They come when I find a moment of peace or solace. 5,000 dead. 100,000 more to come. Who?! Who told you?! Iâ€™m scared for my parents. My entire family. My friendsâ€™ parents. Their entire family. Isolation is maddening and can play tricks on your mind and spirit. You learn who your friends are. Then again, everyone is going â€˜through itâ€™ (for real now) so guess you charge it to that? A friend stayed on the phone with me all night when I thought I had â€˜it.â€™ My throat was so sore and I woke up sweating. She asked if I had been drinking water as usual. I had not. She asked if my heat was on as it was now 70 degrees outside. My heat was on 76 degrees. Sheâ€™s a discerning friend. I am concerned about my business and my ability to be heard/ survive amongst all others with that very concern. Iâ€™m stressed about â€˜grants.â€™ Iâ€™m tired of hearing the word â€˜grant.â€™ People send me â€˜grantsâ€™ all day. Every time I let Banks out he runs. Runs like the wind. He thinks our long walks are done forever so he tries It. Then he returns, resigned to his temporary fate of sitting in the window waiting for the cars that donâ€™t go by. I want to walk too Banks. I want to drive by. Wait - Why are all of these cars driving by? Arenâ€™t yâ€™all supposed to be home? See! I donâ€™t want another text message from a â€˜reputable sourceâ€™ about the â€˜Stanford Act.â€™ Itâ€™s the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act!!! Your reputable source is terrible. I want to get my nails done. Get a pedicure. Get my lashes done. My self-care therapy. I donâ€™t want to feel guilty about that. Notification - â€œCOVID19...â€ I feel guilty about that. I never want-to-eat-another-bean. No more beans! I want a smoothie from my favorite smoothie place. Strawberry banana! Yum yum. With fruit chunks. I sprayed my cup with Lysol the last time I had one and I think it made me sick. I know I drank a decent amount of Lysol. â£ â£ Today, I have decided that I have no control so leaving it to God. Stress will kill you too friends. #Ase
Exactly Like the lysol wipes and spray.
Thank you Lysol for revealing that coronavirus is a fake deadly virus. Meanwhile, Trump is militarizing all borders for a non-existent "drug war" we've seen how many innocent lives died from that during Bush era
What about delicate things like lettuce? I'm assuming you're saying we *don't* need soap anymore but if we need lysol to wipe down a box then how is water going to be enough? I could see the scrubbing action on apples or oranges maybe being helpful enough but you can't scrub delicate things like lettuce or berries so how is rinsing it off going to help with covid? Won't all that do is just rinse dirt and any possible pests off like normal? And if water *is* enough then do we not have to sterilize our sink and surrounding cleaning area due to water splashback and the sink now being contaminated?
Lysol body spray is the best solution for reporters
Dude u actually have a brain unlike most of the idiots commenting this is crazy as f spraying your food off with lysol chemicals all over no way
NO, not with a sponge! ðŸ¤£ There are lots of DIY recipes out there, but there are also lots of wrong info. . ðŸ¦ Many of the recipes and mat washes work for general cleaning but these are not intended to destroy bacteria or viruses. Under current covid-19 environment, you need a proper disinfectant. But which one? . ðŸ¦ So Jade did some tests with a bunch of disinfectants and found that the BEST option for your natural mats is the Lysol range - they were found to be the *least damaging* of all. In such uncertain times, we know weâ€™d rather have a mat die earlier than us... And even if youâ€™re using another sustainable brand or a PVC mat - health comes first & the same thing applies. . ðŸ¦ For those whoâ€™ve picked up one of our mats at thegreencollective.sg or isetansg (& in fact all our Singapore yogi friends), you can get a Lysol on Qoo-10 or probably in various supermarkets (or try your luck getting a delivery with Redmart!). Keep your mats sanitised, not just your hands. . ðŸ¦ Share this post with your yogi friends!
Soo is the an April Fool's prank or Nah? Also I too have the sometimes itchy of the throat and the cough like once every 3 days or something and does sometimes sneeze here and there but I think that's because of all of the dust in ny house or the Lysol I always spray
Why are they wasting lysol spray though?
Me : low income busy mom. Just going to Lysol the heck out of stuff and call it good, hoping for the best.
Covid-19 is new they say, funny how's it's on Lysol since 80's

I'm a smart cookie. I have stockpiled up on toilet paper, rubbing alcohol, baby wipes, disinfectant wipes and bleach. You name it, I've got it. I'm ready for the Apocalypse. In no way do I think I'm bringing the apocalypse on by hoarding all these things because I'm ready to survive. Never mind that my neighbor wasn't able to get any rubbing alcohol or whatever and now is dealing with surfaces that may have Coronavirus and contracts the virus and possibly gives it to people I know, let alone my family or possibly even me. No! I got my stockpile. Also, I can sell a $5 bottle of Lysol for $100, or how about $10 a roll for toilet paper. I'm a money maker, a true capitalist. Everyone look at how smart I am. Never mind that I'm bringing on more instability and crisis because I'm prepared. I've taken care of myself. I'm number one. (I enjoy holding up a mirror to show others how fashionable they are)

Should be worried about getting a McVirus. Who would be dumb enough to get fast food out right now. Duh!! Those people sweat over griddles, rub their noses, and scratch anything that itches. I am sure they sanitize their hands for 20 seconds. Also, it would be impossible to do all this stuff with Lysol! Oh Yes feed my family lysol burgers with open exposed stale bread, and then some sanitizer oreos. hey thats a new flavor for oreos!! Sanitized oreos with a creamy lysol filling. Extra stuff please.
kxmode ok but are you taking off your shoes, spraying it with Lysol all around, removing all your clothes shirt and pants and hats if youâ€™re wearing them before stepping inside the house and delegating them in a bag and washing them later. And are you also Lysoling all the door handles of the house?
you can make your own santizer with aloe vera gel (or glycerine) and rubbing alcohol if you can't find it in stores. And there are cleaners out there other than Lysol. Lysol distributers suck for what they did and I hope they are prosecuted at the end of this for price gouging.
The pastor and his wife at the church my husband leads music at, both have confirmed corona virus. They were air lifted yesterday to the hospital near their home because they were so weak. They are in the I.C. U. The hospital put them on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin . I'm glad I have never gone to that church now. The church has been closed for the past two weeks so it has been 2 weeks since my husband has been there and so far he has no symptoms I am hoping this will remain the case. I have liposomal vitamin C and Quercetin we are both taking and I am disinfecting with hydrogen peroxide right from the bottle that I attached a sprayer to. I wipe everything down a couple times a day. I also have 3 cans of lysol because I always keep it on hand. Anytime someone in our family is sick I spray the living room at night after we go to bed and the bedrooms in the day and the bathrooms every day.

For anyone that still has to go to work, the virus is aerosolized by toilet flushing. It would be best if only one person at a time were in a bathroom, even with several stalls, use LOTS of Lysol/aerosol antiseptic sprays and you should probably do your business, wash your hands, open the door and -only then-...flush & RUN & close the door behind you! The longer you hang in the bathroom after flushing, the more aerosolized virus you may be inhaling, or just get in your hair. Good luck, everybody. Stay vigilant.
My question is where are you buying hand sanitizers and lysol LOL, sold out everywhere
That's all good but remind him to bring some N95 masks with him..... oh, and some Charmin Mega Rolls..... Lysol, too.
I got 4 rolls of toilet paper 4 rolls of paper towels and 3 cans of Lysol on ebay for only $650.00 ðŸ˜¬
...in the light of all this ..covid-19 virus..wear gloves...spray stuff with lysol...my best..!

It's no hand santizer, Lysol or tee tree oil. Walmarts not restocking my pressure beginning to boil. It's no alcohol wipes, I guess I'll use a can of steel. Drink half and swipe it out for a pill. I'm losing my mind..no I lost it already, Im eating meatless spaghetti. The cats food low, the dog foods gone. But the gas is cheap, so I'll keep my search on. Pretty God for a 51 year old huh ?

I like how the manâ€™s bottle of Lysol wipes was just chilling ðŸ˜Ž
Hey Dr. Mike, could you talk about Jeffree Star and his roommates spraying Lysol on their food and drinks in his latest YouTube video? It obviously isnâ€™t good but what are the risks associated with it?

@Sir Aragon of Enid My Big Sister is a RN in NYC. Our parents got her a hazmat suit & some of her nursing buddies. They have been wearing those. They have been using Lysol & Bleach to clean. They have been using vicks. They have been re-washing everything in Lysol wash. They are tired but they are all okay.

CORONAVIRUS IS NOT NEW PEOPLE!!! ITS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES!!! CHECK YOUR OLD LYSOL WIPE CANS AND MORE!!! RADIATION POISONING IS WHAT THIS REALLY IS!!! PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE!!! THEY SAID YOU COULD BE INFECTED FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS AND STILL NOT FEEL SICK!!! SAME THING WITH RADIATION!!!! HOW COME CHINA ISN'T STILL BEING INFECTED AND THIS IS WHERE THIS ALL STARTED? POPULATION CONTROL PEOPLE!!! STOP USING 5G!!!
I got a package in the mail yesterday. I wiped the whole outside of the package with Lysol, washed my hands, took two Lysol wipes and stapled them together to fit around my one hand, opened the package with my makeshift â€œLysol gloveâ€ and then washed my hands again. All I can say is that Iâ€™m really proud of all of the people that still have to go out and work at this time.
This virus is not a new thing, look on a can of Lysol; or maybe the makers are psychic. So why shut down the planet? I keep seeing how this virus is going to change the very landscape of our lives!! Here is what is happening while we set at home, waiting on a virus, that has an incubation time of 6 days, for 45 days!! 5g towers are being installed all over the place; John Hopkins released a few heat maps, if You lay a heat map down for this virus, and overlay a 5g coverage map over it; You'll get the weirdest coincidence I have ever seen!!
luxaholic anonymous no - do not spray masks with Lysol. see the last link in my reply above about how to â€œdisinfectâ€ a mask - best advice seems to be just let it dry out (from mouth moisture?) for hours - maybe heat? I would treat it like clothing... while I wear separate cloths for outside use (jacket, hat, pants) currently - I donâ€™t wash them every day unless I think they got contaminated by close contact.
I need some Lysol spray wipes and hand sanitizer.
Lysol...read what is printed on the can!
"mom look", shows maddy with the Lysol and and redbull, "wtf why did she open the can and put a straw then spray it with Lysol", " idk mom, maybe the corona virus made them do it"
Pockets are the comfort food of clothes. Thatâ€™s right...We said it. Feeling awkward? Just put your hands in your pockets and ðŸ’¥BOOMðŸ’¥ you are instantly cool.ðŸ•¶ Hands a bit chilly? ðŸŒ¬ðŸ‘‹ Yep....pockets. Pockets rule. Period. This harem maxi is the cure for the Covid-19 blues. Wear it + just wait...youâ€™ll start twirling around dancing. We already know dancing cures everything! ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽµCause Iâ€™ve got one hand in my pocket and the.... Alanis knows the importance of pockets. Just $54 and if youâ€™re local, weâ€™ll drop it like itâ€™s hotðŸ”¥ (literally, weâ€™ll spray it down with Lysol like itâ€™s on fire!) on your doorstep if youâ€™re within ðŸ”Ÿ miles!ðŸ“
I hear a lot of people talking about using bleach, alcohol, and Lysol products. What about ammonia based cleaning products or something as common as Windex?
Online is even more ridiculous than in store online I saw a few things of lysol they were wanting $30+ for it that's not even counting shipping.

My comment is coming from deep concern and not disrespect. There's so much wrong with this advice. I don't even know where to start. What are his sources that it's safe to spray Lysol on cheese bags? I wonder what Clorox and Lysol companies would say about using their products in contradiction to the labels. It is not intended for spraying on food packaging and you're supposed to rinse the residue off anything that could come in contact with food. It's very potent. Also, there's rampant inconsistency in the video. If basic rinsing of produce is okay, why not rinse the cheese bag rather than spray chemicals on it?

Whatever happened to Reckitt-Benckiser making more Lysol?
Is transmission really as simple as someone touching your dog once and incidentally touching your face sometime later? Has it been proven to be that easy? You subsequently said someone infected with covid 19 handling your food is unlikely to transmit it to you. I feel like there's a lot of mixed information. I want to give Mike my PRAISE for discrediting that ABSURD video of that "doctor" spraying Lysol on food. If rinsed off dish soap is deemed unsafe to ingest, you better believe chemical disinfectants are!!!

The coronavirus and its homies when they get sprayed with lysol: 0:39 #thememesheep
@C S I do all those things, I spray my shoes before bringing them into the house, I actually strip by the door and put everything a black garbage bag and to the washing machine, I put drops of lysol and clorox on the clothes I just wore to go outside even if it was only for 10 minutes getting a newspaper. : ) then I jump into the shower wash my hair ect. then all good. LOL
Remove your shoes or boots _immediately_ when entering your home. The soles could be covered not only with the virus but all sorts of nasty germs. Do not walk around with your shoes inside. If you cannot remove them outside, take only one step inside before removing them. And be careful where you walk with your socks, you don't want to walk over filth brought in by your shoes and then spread it everywhere. I like to give a little spray of lysol to the sole of my shoes, for good measures. Removing your shoes should be the norm all year round, whether there is a pandemic or not.
My landlord and roommate are requiring all food containers to be sprayed with lysol or the containers to be bleached. Even the paper outside of my sub they insisted on it being lysoled or bleached. Will lysol or bleach reach my food by going through the light paper wraps the food is wrapped in? Also, is it critical that everything be lysoled or bleached when it enters the house?
There are no states with Full lockdown. They say CT and NY is, no is not we still have to work out here factories, auto shops, restaurants u name it... The residents have been asking for a full lockdown or Give us mask because this distance is not working so OBVIOUS... GIVE US MASKS , SEND US MORE CLEANING SUPPLIES like clorox, lysol so we can keep our house were we and our family live in... look at all the Asian countries the've been wearing masks, they have control this virus better than us. China has 1.4 billion people and less than 90,000 sick and USA only has over 330 million and we almost have 200thousand sick. This is an embarrassment to US.
Spray your shoes with lysol before you get in your car or get back home.People coughing droplets fall on floor.You bring it home on your shoes.Unbelievable these doctors don't say this.
Hope you stocked up on your essentials ðŸ˜· #vodka #coronavirus #covid19 #foxnews #cnn #trump #wtf #lordy #lysol #positivity #facemask #laughter #2020 #byefelicia #boo #stayinside #washyouhands #corona #Godblessyou #coveryourmouth #funny #lmao #LOL #springbreak #walmart #quarantine #quarantinelife #quarantini #stockpile #shopping

I always wash my hands after petting my dog. Only hard habit for me is touching my face mainly cause it itches a lot, but I rarely if ever go out and when I do, I don't touch, wipe my hands with Lysol and also wash my hands throughly.

So Covid 19 known as the corona virus is brand new never before seen or know and yet it is listed in the spray can of Lysol? So, did Lysol see into the future or am I missing something here with the fact it is supposed to be some new virus and yet is listed on a disinfectant spray can.
I'm going to bring a can of Lysol everytime. ðŸ˜‚
@Lee Garrett so that's CNN in China fault of why there is lack of testing and ventilators? Why someone basically has to be bedridden in order for a hospital to be willing to spare a test kit? It sounds to me that this administration was not on top of it if we were there would be plenty of tests to go around.I don't know about you but I remember watching him about a week ago saying how people should wash down there respirators? I'm no doctor but I have plenty of friends that are nurses and they say that once you get a respirator wet or damp it defeats the purpose! Kansas spray Lysol on a n95 mask and expect it to work!and I'm saying that from experience I'm a painter and I've done plenty of demolition and sanding that I've used these and once you get them wet their junk! Just admitted no country was prepared so don't act like we're doing a great job! Or better yet the president is cuz he's not! So yeah it's CNN fault!
Imma start spraying people with Lysol when they breathe on my neck while paying ðŸ˜‚
How is it a new virus when itâ€™s been in the back of Lysol Cans for years ??!?!?!?!

El 13 de marzo fue tomada esta foto ..hace un poco mÃ¡s de 2 semanas. Con todo lo que ha pasado pareciera que fue hace un siglo. Recuerdo que fue mi ULTIMO dÃ­a en la calle sin mascarillas, guantes, spray de Lysol y toda la parafernalia que ahora es la normalidad. Fui al estudio de wentactuk quien me honrÃ³ pidiÃ©ndome estar en su serie Mujeres Wonder. Me lo pensÃ© , porque ya habÃ­a empezado a asomar su cabeza el #coronavirus y algo me decÃ­a que esto no venÃ­a normal. Los niÃ±os fueron conmigo , Wendy siempre los trata tan bien. Pero a parte de todo fue dÃ­a relativamente normal. La agenda estaba llena , de hecho tuve una maestrÃ­a de ceremonia en la maÃ±ana y aprovechÃ© el maquillaje para la foto ðŸ¤ª. . Esa noche vi las noticas , las redes y pensÃ© bueno.. un poco mÃ¡s de precauciÃ³n y a votar con mascarilla el domingo. Y desde ese domingo me puse en cuarentena. 18 dÃ­as mÃ¡s tarde el mundo del que me encerrÃ© ha cambiado mucho. SÃ­, estamos alejados pero a la vez mÃ¡s unidos que nunca. SÃ­, no hay iglesias abiertas pero si mÃ¡s Fe que nunca. SÃ­, los relojes se han detenido, pero el tiempo se hizo mÃ¡s valioso. El encierro nos saca lo mejor y lo peor. La situaciÃ³n nos igualÃ³ a todos y cambiÃ³ mucho mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido de lo que podÃ­amos entender. . Dentro de la incertidumbre sÃ³lo algo me queda claro : saldremos TODOS mejor de esto. Apreciaremos, saborearemos y vamos a valorar todo mÃ¡s - hasta los tapones. ðŸš˜ Ã‰ramosâ€œricosâ€ y no lo sabÃ­amos.. . Saldremos de esto. SÃ³lo te pido que la #cuarentente no te deje igual. Que no sÃ³lo la sobrevivas sino que la aproveches para mirar esas cosas en tu interior que evitas y que callas. Buen momento para enfrentarlas, mejorarlas y superarlas. . Ãnimo mi gente, cada dÃ­a falta un dÃ­a menos.. #covid_19 #cuarentena #reflexion #pensandoando #comoloveo
Ask the fed govmt for Lysol spray,stop asking for ventilators.

This virus beast gets even medical crew and they know how to don hazmat, masks, etc! Just think how vulnerable the general public is! I can attest that this it takes absolute extra care and knowledge in how to not become infected with this virus! Hand washing is not enough. Strip down to your skivvies when you are inside your house and have a bag ready to put them in to wash immediately. Leave your shoes at the door and spray with lysol or bleach with water. Get those clothes into the wash and go take a shower...wash your hair too. The virus sticks to hair and clothes and skin. Wear a tightly woven scarf if you can not obtain masks..you can even make your own masks. There are instructions in how to on youtube. They aren't as effective as surgical masks but again, it's better then nothing. To avoid getting this virus, stay home...this is no joke! HCQ is promising and we need to break the chain of infection. Severe pts. with this virus need to have HCQ (with zinc & azithromycin) administered and then moderate cases. Pills are a heck better then ventilators! Thank you Doctor Vuong for your videos!

I m pretty sure that's exactly what it means.but I saw a study somewhere where they looked at 770 people that died of the corona virus,and 766 of those people had existing health conditions.that means that the chances of you dying,providing you are in relatively good health,is a lot less than 1%. I wouldn't panic. Just pray to God to be spared from this pestilence,wear our gloves,wear a mask every time you enter a store or any enclosed space,throw away your gloves as soon as you get home and spray your shoes with Lysol and everything else you feel you need to spray,even if it's the air in the hallway.God bless.

You are showing that you care, Dr. VanWingen, & for that I am thankful. You are so correct in that none of us is perfect - that simply means that we are part of the human race. LOL I use a "better safe than sorry" attitude when dealing w/possible contagious germs in the kitchen & around our home. I don't care who might think I am excessive. The proof that my method has worked well is in the fact that we have NOT had to deal w/colds or the flu since using my methods of being free of as many contagious germs as possible. However, w/all the still unknowns around COVID-19, I am determined to be more careful than ever. We are NOT running scared of death, b/c we know the *One* who is sovereign over all - including the number of our days on planet Earth. However, I will use the common sense the good *Lord* has granted me while still here. I have sanitized every item that has come into our home for years now & would like to suggest: (1) Work w/disposable gloves on while dealing w/the goods straight out of the plastic bags & w/the plastic bags. (2) It is a good idea to take a plastic dishpan or two out to the garage or wherever you are airing out goods & dump the inner wrapped foods into it & dispose of the outer wraps & the plastic bags out there, to avoid bringing any possible "glitter" into your home - & dispose of those gloves before touching the dishpan(s) to go indoors. (3) Do the same w/produce = get rid of those plastic bags right away = less possible glitter getting inside your home. (4) Consider that you have touched the possibly contaminated item w/the hand that you end up using to place it it on the clean side, so it is a good idea to only touch the outside top area & after placing it on the clean side go over that area w/the wipe. (5) Change the wipe often, b/c eventually it will be covered w/the very germs you are working to eliminate. (6) For good measure I have always wiped products twice...first w/a straight vinegar rinse to get rid of dirt & some of the surface germs & the second wipe is w/Lysol wipes to rid the product of most, if NOT all germs. A solution of 4 teaspoons bleach to 4 cups of water would work well for the second wipe, too. (6) W/fruits & vegetables I rinse w/hot water, spray straight vinegar on each, & then rinse w/cold water & air dry. For the record: I used some of these same techniques in the classroom & my class had way fewer than the average absences in other classes during the cold & flu season. It works! May you enjoy the protection & provision that the good *Lord* in *His* mercy grants you!

Thank you for a great video Jeff! I have actually done this for years. With taking care of my Father I always lysol wipe my packages before putting them away. The only thing i would recommend (and I'm no expert either) would be to put the freshly washed fruit into a bowl after washing versus putting it in the sink where the washing it getting done, and changing the cleaning cloth a bit more to a new one, that's just me though! I have my own cleaning OCD's, LOLOL. Thank you again for brining awareness to the issue!

Hi Mag! Love that you are still bringing the truth here on YouTube as well as your podcast. I can't speak for all other scarce items like toilet paper and lysol products and i wouldn't doubt them making it look worse than it is. But my dad is a butcher at a grocery store and they cannot restock the shelves fast enough. The "panic dummies" really are buying way more than they need unfortunately.
Man we out here like savages! Only if I can find some Lysol spray.

I work in healthcare and I have had to buy my own masks. I wear my sometimes 2-3 days before I switch it out. I spray it with Lysol in between wears which is not suppose to happen. My managers have been questioning me as to were received my masks. When I told her I bought it myself she states that others have been asking about MY mask in particular. I was then told I didnâ€™t need to wear the mask unless Iâ€™m in direct care which I am when Iâ€™m getting patientâ€™s vitals. Iâ€™m a chronic asthmatic and therefore I will wear what I need to protect myself and my family as best I can.
I would love to sanitize my groceries. The problem is that there are no wipes, lysol spray at the store. We have 2 tiny bottles of hand sanitizer. I was going to make my own, but there is no alcohol. All I can do is keep the bags out of my house and wash anything that comes in.
Lysol body spray is the best solution for reporters
but Lysol does not kill this strain of corona virus? So why spray everything with lysol

If you order a package, spray it with Lysol and let it sit for a bit before bringing it inside. -a tip from our paranoid family
The National Institutes of Health looked into this earlier this month and found the #coronavirus can last on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic or stainless steel for around two to three days. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of cleaning products that can be used on surfaces against coronavirus, and Lysol is among them.

Quick PSA to Airbnb hosts, homes and businesses with cleaning crews during this ðŸ¦ Coronavirus outbreak: *Please stock up on Clorox Cleaner, Disinfecting wipes , Lysol sprays, and Hand sanitizer too! You want cleaners to wipe AND spray anything that gets touched after every checkout. Either allow an extra charge or stock up so they can use what you have. *Pull all dishes and silverware to run in the dishwasher for sanitation. I suggest you book a deep cleaning every visit and include a checklist. *If You need a deeper clean then BLOCK off same day checkins and actually give cleaners time to fully sanitize your units without feeling like they are going to miss sanitizing throughout your home or business. I hope these tips assist everyone in keeping their homes and business virus ðŸ¦  free. ***For any questions, concerns or bookings please DM or call 678-939-7834 to lock in your appointments.

@RAY RAY I don't know honey, I just don't know. All we can do now is make sure of everything we are doing. When you bring groceries home wipe them down with lysol. I wear gloves, and masks. Take care and God bless you..
Pretty sure most aren't, and are YOU gonna buy all that Lysol?
Why is it that America is scared and/or hesitant about speaking about Straussian topics? I think this is where the problem stems in terms of finding a realistic solution in getting the economy back into working action. Are we trying to slow the rate in which people contract covid19 to avoid exhausting medical workers? Or not contract the virus it all together? Realistically most of us are going to contract this at some point, so how are we going to adapt? I hope not hoarding toilet paper and building Lysol forts. cheeksandlegs

This was supposed to be a post about healthy skin care rituals while in quarantine. But this morning I canâ€™t stop thinking about our active essential workers (including health care workers) on the front line treating COVID19 patients as my mom is now and to those workers who are keeping NYC still functioning. Both my mom and I have worked in medicine collectively for over 40 years. Before I was born, she was a critical and intensive care provider. Before people started panicking over wiping surfaces and being mindful of clean spaces, my mom always told my brother and I to wash our hands after coming home from school, changing into home clothes and wearing slippers, instructing us to Lysol spray the bottom of our school bags and wipe our cell phones and keyboards. To us, this was normal. When you work in health care, you learn and incorporate into your life safe and sterile protocols. Itâ€™s just how my mom was (and still is) and something that helped me in medical school and now as a birth worker where personal hygiene and personal protective equipment is more important than ever in the labor wards. She was the reason I went to medical school, the reason I devoted my life to health and wellness, the reason why I also decided to commit my life after medical school to bring my clinical expertise, medical experience and skills to care for birthing mamas both as part of the medical team and beyond. Sorry this isnâ€™t a post about skin care but it is a post about personal care and how Iâ€™m actually really thankful my mom taught me these clean and sterile routines early on. Stay safe out there for those of who you need to go out. ðŸ’ª #womeninmedicine #medicine #healthcare #healthcareworkers #grateful #covid19 #quarantine #realtalk #reallife #doctor #nurses #midwife #doula #essentialworkers #humbled #gratitude #gratefulheart #humanity #kindness #heroes #birthworker #childbirth #worldhealth #globalhealth #staysafe #hygiene #perspective

@Lisa Cundiff we just bought hand sanitizer, bleach, wipes, lysol spray....not even a problem here. In fact, If I didn't watch the news, there would be very little evidence that anything was wrong. This is the same sentiment from most people in Virginia. with exceptions to possibly NOVA.

Thank you for this....I follow most of this advice. When Fed Ex delivers cardboard boxes to our porch, I spray them w/Lysol, put them on our screened porch for awhile. I go to P.O. to get our mail daily....I wear disposable gloves & I spray the mail w/Lysol & leave it on screened porch awhile, too. I have shared this video to Face Book & will be sending it to friends via email. Thank you very much for doing this service.
Should we be using a different Lysol wipe each time we wipe off an item? I feel if we donâ€™t we could be wiping bad germs into the next item.
Those of us struggle everyday just to make a living are not going faint over this -- or go out and buy up all the toilet paper and Lysol because we know: OTHER PEOPLE NEED IT TOO.
I do and spray lysol all over them
Ok my mind is wigging out here! Ok he sanitized the drugs tossing the medication papers I would have used Lysol on. He is buying things like fresh broccoli that hand have touched and people have coughed all over just buy frozen you can wash the bag it comes in with soap and water if you wanted and the bread he bought was out in the open being handled by workers who I promise you did not wear face masks and possibly not gloves either depending on what time of the day they bagged it and by not cleaning the cereal box and opening it instead now the bag you poor it from has it omg my mind canâ€™t handle the rest of this video I bet he wears his shoes in the house and sits on the couch in his uncleared outside close without any type of decontamination or like my brother who is a P.P.E less caveman ðŸ˜‚

Wipe down groceries with lysol. Shopping bags need to be thrown away or soaked in a mixture of bleach and water then sun dry
Aren't you possibly RE-INFECTING everything you just WIPED the one side of the counter AFTER you started using the SAME cloth to then WIPE off the GROCERIES? Sorry, but I have been going through Lysol Wipes like no tomorrow.....IF I wiped down my counter I would throw the first WIPE away, get another one, etc? ************************************************* I've always washed my fruit/veggies like you do.....for 30 yrs.
I wonder what my old boss is doing now? He only supplied 1 can of lysol per building for two weeks, was stingy with gloves and had a no bleach rule??!
Are you guys hiring? You can pay me with toilet paper rolls and Lysol
@Th3Sh1n1gam1 Yeah...and notice his attitude? And how he says "if" we do this. You ever had a whole city stop before or all the bars shut down and homeless disappear, like all the tent cities in my town are gone and they closed the shelters...ya know lysol kills this virus? Says it on the can You can believe what you want. Why didn't this Dr say NO travel by airplanes just two weeks ago if we we're getting "ahead" of this...or watch a video of him from a month ago. Why did 'they' wait?

I hope everyone is staying safe and taking the necessary precautions with the advent of COVID-19. Vitamin C can help strengthen the body against attack, 1-3 grams per day. Hydroxychloroquine can kill the virus. Chaga mushroom may kill the virus. Beyond this us lysol and hand sanitizer when going out shopping or other public places. Social distance, at least 6 feet spacing from all people. Do not touch your face. Cough deep into your arm if you have symptoms. If you have symptoms STAY AT HOME! Get a friend to deliver groceries to your door or use delivery services. If you are showing mild symptoms take all precautions as well as use a mask, gloves and goggles. Actually everyone should be using Gloves, Mask, and Goggles but there is likely supply shortages. But if you have them, use them! We will be in this severe lockdown for at least 2 more months, stay strong. Stay safe, laugh, and be kind. Kind regards, Abatos
(CAUTION: Extremely long boring comment and one good tip but you've probably heard it all before. Just my input)> I'm bout 6hrs late gettin here to this excellent video. Went to Walmart bout 8pm CST and forgot my mask and gloves. Duh. And I'm still a certified Advanced EMT with 30yrs experience. Got too much on my mind. I only picked up baby formula for granddaughter and few other items including Lysol spray EXACTLY like he is using, as it was being unboxed, and sprayed the bottom of my boots when I got home, my leather police/shooting gloves and the plastic formula container but wasn't as thorough as he is even tho I know better. Gonna get better half to watch this tomorrow. We're both 65 and pretty healthy but I've already cut out fast food for us and our son and his 8yr old and 15 month old daughters. I'm the only one goin shopping or refueling our vehicles. I've worked in many 3rd world countries over the years as security contractor and donating my time to guard medical missionaries and the conditions for the people living there are worse than this all the time. No clean water or sewage system. Electric power is spotty in the ghettos and non-existent in the jungle and desert villages. No health care. I've met folks in their 60s and up who had never seen a doctor before the missionaries came. As Americans we are spoiled in many ways, from homeless to billionaires, we can all usually get food and medical care. I should have watched the whole vid first but if you're still reading this here's my tip for good times/bad times. Have a spray bottle of disinfectant by your home's entry to spray the bottoms of your footwear before you enter your residence. We all walk around in unbelievable filth and germs everytime we go out then track at least some of it thru our homes and then walk around barefoot. It dawned on me over 20 years ago while taking off my boots one morning after a shift on the ambulance and saw blood and crud on the soles from an shooting we had worked. I first started just taking off my boots before I came in but then got to thinking about just everyday life outside our homes and started the spray bottle thing. Unfortunately time goes by, we forget or get complacent so we haven't done it as regular as we should but have started back. We live in southeast Tennessee in a rural county near Chattanooga and so far there are 2 couples, went on cruise ship, that are sick and quarantined but heard 2 days ago that a 69yr old guy I knew from highschool days had passed away from the virus. We have 30 miles of interstate running thru our county with 7 exits so it only takes one infected traveler to stop to get fuel or whatever and start a thread of contamination. I've heard so called experts say that everyone in the U.S. will eventually contract this virus tho some will show no symptoms but still be contagious. Our survival, amount of sickness or worst case, death, will depend largely on our individual immune systems ability to fight the virus unless a vaccine is found. I have talked to a few doctors and some people I know in the federal government that say the virus is already mutating and one strain is possibly destroying lung tissue. We have owned our car magazine for 30 years. We are shutting down the office tomorrow. If things improve we can go strictly internet but that is down the road. We are not depending on or counting on the government to bail us out. It is sickening on it's own how little of the 2 trillion dollars is actually goin to help people and to fight the virus. Someone pointed out that if every person in this country, young, old, legal or illegal got $1200 that that "only" comes to 40 billion dollars. The bulk is for politicians pet projects like museums, diversity studies and other ridiculous things. Even in this time of suffering, physical and financial, the greedy politicians can't help themselves from robbing the country some more. This country could save most of us and the whole world but it won't because of power and greed. Well, that's my sermon for tonight brought to you by worry and PTSD. I realize this won't be read but I write when I'm scared sometimes and I'm definitely scared now. Gotta go wipe down more things. Don't forget that spray bottle. L8r.
Just drive your car into Winco or wherever you shop. Do not get out and make sure to honk out of respect before driving into the store. When you need to pay for your items be sure to unlock the trunk - spray your cash with lysol and those near your car. Once this is all said and done drive home - spray your car with lysol and your clothing. When you receive a bill for damages - just apply for bankruptcy. Your welcome.ðŸ¤£
Maine pm cares fund me daan nhi diya aur dena bhi nhi chahta. balki mere se jo bana wo maine apne pados ke gareeb logo ko rashan sanitizer lizol wagerah diya
I've been stopping at Walmart and targets throughout this epidemic...I dont want to say I'm doing all the right safety measures but I try to sanitize my hands immediately after leaving store and lysol my phone and whatever I buy when I get in car. I have a cracked sternum right now and pray I dont get this thing
I remember before covid 19 got real bad in the US people laugh at me because I had a can of Lysol spray itâ€™s very possible that some of those same people wish they would have taken it more serious like I did
Heâ€™s in his own basement. His family can still bring him stuff. They just need to close off the vents and practice good technique- handwashing, cautious handling of his used plates / cutlery. I lived through it and managed not to infect either of my roommates and the three of us share one bathroom and kitchen. I used a shitload of Lysol and lived on soda water, vitamins and yogurt, lost 15 lb in 2 weeks, but weâ€™re all okay. Iâ€™m 47, my roommates are 56 and 26.

I wear a blue mask and rubber gloves when out getting groceries in public. When i leave the store, i use antibacterial lotion on my GLOVES AND every time i go to another place, i spray the mask inside and out with lysol!! Maybe the masks wont prevent Covid-19 but there are plenty of other things in the air a person can get which could compromise their immune system, especially if they are elderly! Why take a chance on getting ANY sort of cold, mumps measles or ANYTHING else which could compromise your system.. the healthier we stay the less chance we have of contracting the TRUMP VIRUS,!! Remember this tragedy when itâ€™s time to vote!! VOTE A BLUE TSUNAMI AND DRAIN THE WHITE HOUSE CESS POOL STARTING WITH THE PERSON WHO CALLED THIS PANDEMIC A HOAX FOR MONTHS WHILE THOUSANDS BLISSFULLY WALKED AROUND AND BECAME INFECTED,! Down with HERR TRUMP and ALL of his republiKKKAN ENABLERS, hopefully the SURVIVING family members of the dead will see how DANGEROUS â˜ ï¸ðŸ’€â˜ ï¸ A PERSON tRUMP IS AND SPARE OTHER FAMILIES THAT SAME UNTHINKABLE GRIEF!!!

Thank you Mr. World Famous Doctor and Author. You're the boss. (Subbed. Why the cute ones always younger than me? You have a babyface). Uh oh Yaw! Andrew Yang's twin - another Asian who likes math. Preach brother. Yaas! Whew hoo. Yaaas. Now more than 60 doctors in Italy have died. April 1, 2020 and yet US Americans are hoarding masks and other protective gear. You can't even buy Lysol.
Keep safe bro, wear acetate face shield to cover your face from micro-droplets covid-19.. Disinfect your car with Lysol, Xonrox mix to water(1/1) or Alcohol.
Hey stupid the mask are all gone the gloves gone the grabbers and horderds grab them all and everyone of them were Bernie supporters no lysol spray no hand cleaner no soap all gone. They did restock food toilet paper paper towels .the greedy vultures took everything .
MASKS DO HELP! Its absolutely ridiculous at this point to say/think masks don't help. U can reuse ur masks. Either put in a bag for 9 days,u can spray the outside lightly with Lysol spray & let dry completely. Peak Prosperity did a video about masks the other day...I strongly advise watching bc it gives SCIENTIFIC proof of how to Sterilize masks & why masks do help U could even use coffee filters between scarves if u really need something.
Meanwhile, at Ebay USA, $100 can of Lysol gets posted no questions asked.
Simple. Everyone would panic as they have been and would buy every single mask like they did the toilet paper. Have you noticed, people are literally paying $1000 for a can of Lysol disinfectant spray, not knowing that soap does a better job.
Will spraying lysol work?

Corona virus has always been around, check the back of your lysol products.
Thought the coronavirus challenge was dancing around with lysol.
My husband and I both were very sick the end of January, so I thought I could share with you a few tips that we had used and it seem to work, now I must say my mother is in the medical field so some of these tips I got from her. First of all you want to drink as much orange juice as possible the vitamin C is very important also we use thermal flu as well we had used cold compacts for the temp you can use those cold compacts on top of the head or underneath the armpit these are the areas that regulate temperature on the body as well we use Tylenol, Alka-Seltzer plus, and took a hot hot showers, also sprayed down the house with Lysol spray very very strongly and wipe down all knobs, remotes, cell phones, anything that could be touched was wipe down, like knobs on cabinetry just anything knobs on the toilets the sink you name it, Iâ€™m sure you get the idea but after about a week and a half we did recover. Now for me I went over and seen my doctor very quickly it moved from my head to my chest and since I had experience pneumonia in the past I knew what it look like or felt like should I say so I got to my doctor and he did put me on an anabiotic, now if I wouldâ€™ve not done that I believe this wouldâ€™ve gotten really bad it was very very aggressive once I took the five days of antibiotics I did start feeling much better, as for my husband it didnâ€™t move into his chest like it had with me but I have been prone to pneumonia in the past. Hope this was some helpful tips. Best of luck to you and your family! God bless ðŸ™
@Francisco Abreu Exactly...Corona Virus has been on the back of Lysol can for years...this is another strain...you are correct sir.
As a trucker who drives in to New York every day I can tell you it's not just amazon. My company gave us nothing! Every driver is responsible for sanitizing the truck you get for the day yourself. Hundreds of drivers in my job are traveling in to NY, NJ, RI, MA in and meeting back at the yard in Connecticut, sharing trucks without knowing who last person that the driver came in contact with or how clean these people even are, and we are expected to sanitize trucks with supplies purchase from our pocket only if we can find wipes and lysol spray available anywhere. I started coming home late just so my son is asleep when I get home, so I have enough time to bag my work clothes, and jump in the shower with having to reject him a hug and expose him to anything.
Message to Gov Cuomo and all other State Governors to extend the life of hospitals front line protective gear. I believe early on it was said that Lysol kills the virus...construct makeshift LYSOL MIST DECON CHAMBERS, individuals would go in and out of these chambers as often as necessary after seeing each patient or whenever, these chamber could even be used to store pre-used gear. I would say DJT is MIA but that really not true he just dosn't care..........DJT, so delusional, the private companies took action because they saw you bickering and fight with Governers about the suupplies they were requesting from the Federal Government (rightfully so "during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC ") need to keep their brave frontline healthcare works (men and women)protected, instead of ensuring they got the supplies they were requesting you went into attack mode. Its silly to attempt to try threaten the private companies AFTER THE FACT THAT THEY THEMSELVES TOOK ACTION IN THE FACE OF THE NON-PRODUCTIVE ACTION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. TO LATE TO TRY AND LOOK LIKE THE BIG HEAD HONCHO IN CHARGE.....FAILED AGAIN!!!

My mom always sprayed Lysol on everything and kept bottles of alcohol in the car to clean her hands and ours....we thought she was crazy but now hand sanitizer exists and Lysol is like gold right now
What if you cannot buy disinfectant anywhere? For the past two months I have been trying to find Lysol or any other effective disinfectant as spray or wipes in any store or online and there are none! We keep being told to use disinfectant but what if there is none available?
How about bringing in your own box to put in the cart first that you know it is clean and if you use Lysol to clean off counter tops, please wash it off with soap and water to clean of the lysol so you do not die from lysol poisoning yourself, clean the counter top after lysol with hot soapy water then use water afterwards, then use paper towls on the counter top.
I gently take it off outside my apt. Spray outside of mask with Lysol. Put in paper bag. Spay myself down. Spray my groceries before putting into my car. Wipe down everything inside shopping bags with damp cloth dipped in bleach water. Learned that watching a vlogger from China. Put clothes in wash. Shower. Watch Netflix.
Bridget Makk I saw that about the choir its so horrible and it sure shows why we need to stay away from each other or we would all be sick and many more would die. I cant believe those people would use the clubhouse and have a gathering , and exercise classes ,seriously older people are so much more vulnerable . Id tell your mom to wear gloves if she has them when she gets mail, and take a lysol wipe or even a paper towel with rubbing alcohol to wipe the doorknob or keypad that they use to get into the clubhouse. Or just not get the mail, her life is worth more than paying her bills at the moment. Are you in the states and your Mom is here ? This is such a scary time.
They reported here in kern county ca they sprayed lysol from the planes
Nephew said when he asked last week, "At least 3 WEEK'S before any TP may be in stock" according to a store employee. A truck driver friend indicated he was able to buy ONE LYSOL WIPES at a WalMart in Wisconsin, they only had 2 LARGE packages on shelf & a LIMIT of "ONE" was in effect. (Truck Drivers carrying food products have their temperature checked by scanner at Security before checking in to LOAD or UNLOAD any food products.ðŸ¤ 
While I â¤ï¸ HEB, I just ordered my every other week GROCERIES, for the SECOND TIME THIS MONTH, NO TOILET PAPER or DISINFECTING WIPES of any kind. If you need insect repellent or hair spray, there's plenty of selections at HEB Deer Park, Tx location, BUT NO TP or DISINFECTING WIPES ðŸ˜ , NO CLOROX or LYSOL wipes or spray's either. Wondering if Kroger or Walmart are any better off? ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤¨ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
Ok lysol, purell and mask for everyone so we can go grocery shopping make in obligatory to where a mask and bring hydro cost down everyone using hot water to wash and clean constantly.
Please Lysol the podium
My husband still work yes with this stupid scary virus coming home with 6 box of gloves and 2 bags of mask he not playing couse he go out everythings to work and I cant found no lysol spray to put inside my house its crazy the only things i have is 91% of alchoholðŸ‘£â¤ðŸ‘¨ðŸ»ðŸ˜·ðŸ§¤ #itsscary #besafehome #coronavirus #stillwork #myhusband #loveit #lovemyhusband #myworld #crazyworld #boxofgloves #boxofmask #facemask #handsgloves ðŸ¤žðŸ§¤ðŸ˜·ðŸ‘¨ðŸ»â¤ðŸ‘£
I wipe them off with Lysol wipes
Exactly this was planed I believe corona is on the bleach bottle Lysol spray and they have no cure
Today was a day. The kind of day that makes you feel dizzy and overwhelmed and like youâ€™re spinning in circles while accomplishing absolutely nothing kind of day. A day that starts with the best of intentions (weâ€™re gonna have a schedule! Chores will be done! Homeschool all the things!) and ends with me picking a muddy toddler up out of a puddle, yelling at my kids to turn the tv off for the upteenth time while simultaneously feeling guilty that I didnâ€™t create some Pinterest like learning environment complete with sensory activities for the 3 year old running around naked with a mixing bowl on his head. And like a giant thundercloud over all the guilt and overwhelm is the choking anxiety of the global pandemic we find ourselves surreally existing in. Am I protecting them enough? Do we have enough Lysol/toilet paper? Did someone just cough? For the love of God stop putting your hands in your mouth! And your brotherâ€™s mouth! But Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s worse. The complete chaos that has become our new daily normal, or the still of night, when the quiet allows all the fear to tumble in like a giant freaking tidal wave of what ifâ€™s. I know I should probably keep this space positive. But above all else I keep this space real. And the reality is that #covid19 has changed our lives forever. When this is over, how long will it take for us to not silently freak out anytime someone isnâ€™t 6 feet away from us in the grocery store? How long will it take before we donâ€™t over analyze everything weâ€™ve touched and the possibilities of where theyâ€™ve been and what horrors could still exist on the surfaces? How long will it take the world to recover, emotionally, economically and physically from this?! I obviously donâ€™t have answers (I donâ€™t even know what day it is) but all I can say is Iâ€™m really looking forward to the day when we can look back on the coronavirus pandemic as a very distant memory. Until then, one day at a time. (Because if I start actually counting the days my kids will be home from school, Iâ€™ll lose all grip on reality) ðŸ’— ps. On the plus side, because we are always together, getting all 4 in the frame isnâ€™t as hard these days #all4ormorechallenge
$19.99 for a can of Lysol, nice photoshop.
This video has a lot of errors lol. He touches "contaminated" things with the same hand he places them on the clean side with. There's no way to physically see that youve brought the virus into your home but you don't need to wash down every single thing you see with Lysol lol.. just wash your hands and don't touch your face. Stay away from people and be smart.

Our own government killed the people in 911. Stop with the propaganda and fear porn. 80,000 people died last year from the flu. Where was the fake news pump about that pandemic?? Maybe microchip tracking coming soon? China propaganda to devalue the dollar and economy more? CDC says there is no test or vaccine. Meanwhile news says get tested. Then reports of false positives. Trump don't trust China test. China censoring the people and any data on the virus. The world is a stage. What I do know for a fact, you cannot catch the AIDS virus ðŸ˜·. Movies like outbreak, contagion, I am legend, etc are science fiction. Which Netflix now calls drama adventure. Germs have been replaced by viruses. If Lysol killed viruses there would be none. They would have found the chemical or compound and made a vaccine or a generic version. Washing your hands kills germs. A virus is made inside your body. That's why it is found inside animals and your body. You first have to contract HIV first, then this can possibly turn into the AIDS virus. Inside your body. Everyone is Born with the cancer virus. Something in life may trigger this and it becomes a disease. You can't catch anything. A germ maybe. Spanish flu was proven not to spread person to person or horse to horse. Facts. Fact check me

I wonder how much money lysol, facemasks and hand sanitizer is going to make. And then I wonder how many trillions of dollars Bill Gates is going to make off this vaccine. It's so lucky of us to have him want to implant chips in us to make sure we get the vaccine. If it goes away in the summer it will be perfect scare tactics to push the "it might come back in fall so you should get the vaccine". ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Every video posted about covid 19 is just the same damn common sense blabber. PEOPLE, if you want life to go back to normal this is what you got to do: STAY HOME. DONT VISIT ANYONE. DO ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING AND PICK UP. EXERCISE IN YOUR HOUSE. STAY OFF SOCIAL MEDIA SO DONT ROT YOUR BRAIN WITH FALSE FACTS. if we would just listen to the experts this would obviously not be growing as large as it has. Everyone out there thinking they not gunna get it it. If I where gloves and masks Iâ€™ll be fine. BULLSHIT. Youâ€™re only making it worse. For those who have to work in this (like me) be smart. Act like everywhere you go you just walked through air that has been tainted like radiation. Use your hand sanitizer spray everything you touch especially in your vehicles and even yourself clothing with fucking Lysol. Iâ€™m in and out of hospitals hotels gas stations grocery stores all day every day as a vendor and thankfully I havenâ€™t got it with over thousands of cases in our state. I canâ€™t believe how many ignorant people their are out there who donâ€™t give a shit. This wonâ€™t go â€œbye byeâ€ by itself we have to make those stats go down by ourselves.
England needs to be handing out free Lysol spray. free bleach and soap to clean repeatedly touched surfaces to kill those microbial Yarmulkes.
Wear a mask? I canâ€™t even get Lysol or alcohol to make my own sanitizer. Got my garden planted. ðŸ‘ðŸ» I came a little late to the party but Iâ€™m listening now.
I live in Georgia, Brian Kemp is a fucking moron. People here are still going to church, restaurants and fast food places are packed, gas stations and even the MOVIE THEATER is packed. Yesterday we went to Publix in an attempt to find bleach and alcohol since everyone's hording Lysol and hand sanitizer and fucking Publix had an elderly man taking bags to people's trunks while young guys were standing around doing nothing. It's an absolute joke here in Georgia and it's only getting worse. Can we please remember that we are humans first before anything else, my god the shame of it all.
This literally about to be Halloween costume next year and forward Mom: what you want to be for Halloween Blaclck Kid: Corona virus Mom: cough Black Kid: get back Corona virus Corona virus ish getting really get back spay lysol cans Mom: cough cough hold up Black kid: dance spying lysol cans
WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS GATHER UP ALL CROP DUSTING PLANES ETC. AND CROP DUST AMERICA WITH LYSOL OR ANY OTHER GERM KILLING PRODUCT.
Donâ€™t spray Lysol they found the virus and stay in the air and attach to it
Gloves are basically useless for the covid-19 because the virus can only get into your body from your face (Iâ€™m pretty sure and Iâ€™m not trying to be rudeâœ¨)

10:08 cardi b: CORONAVIRUS SHIT IS GETTING REALLLLLL me:sprays my computer down lysol me:wahes hands Me:gets the wipes me: THEN SAYS BLESS U
Was wondering if you could help me put? I am definitely at the appropriate amount of concerned and an taking all the recommended steps to protect me and my home from this virus. My husband is losing his mind. Completely irrational...thinks this germ is on anything and everything. In and out of our home. Weve not let anyone into house in 2weeks only gone to store one time. Wiped down everything we brought home accordingly. Stripped at door literally sprays EVERYTHING with lysol over and over now. And this is whether weve left the house or not. We let the dog out in our back yard he sanitized the door knob the leash at least once the dog.....someone couldve can came in our yard...touched or truck......(insanely unlikely) he thinks its in the grass.....u get the picture then he thinks or fears the possibility of it being on everything I've happened to touch i just sanitized my hands or washed them. Or picked up an item that has been on our floor for months...if i put my hand on the bed or counter or touch him im trying to kill us. He thinks it's indefinitely transferrable. Can u please make a video to calm this man ive been with for 20 yrs who is a new germaphobe hear the rational truth? Another example i sanitize and disinfec thoroughly the interior of our truck before bed. Lock the door. Next evening he goes out to start it up for a second he comes back in spraying and sanitizing galore i ask why he claims it could be in truck. Im like how and his reasoning deteriorates to irrationality. This is wearing on us he is an intelligent man but acting very neuroticly. Please help
@_ReaalAmerican_ @Jim_Jordan The coronavirus has been around for 100 years .look on the back of your Lysol it already tells you that it will kill coronavirus if thatâ€™s already been on the bottle? then weâ€™ve already had it before . you guys are not doing your research. wash your hands donâ€™t touch your face ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
@_ReaalAmerican_ @Jim_Jordan This virus is Nothing new with this virus has been around for hundreds of years look at your Lysol can it has been on there and it will kill coronavirus why do you think they say wash your hands donâ€™t touch your face simple directions
@chrisscottsharp @ShadrockQSC @Billionsburg_F I was gonna say the same. And the series came out in 2018. First human coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s. People were freaking out because coronavirus is on the Lysol can. Itâ€™s been there! Netflix took it down though lol! Did you see the latest about patient zero?
@CNN If one spouse has a job that requires daily operations design a distancing plan. Coronavirus is teaching us to be disciplined and caring for one another. Today, LOVE is cleanliness, Lysol, and reminders to WASH before bed.
@cuffstheaviator Soap and water works too. I also regularly cleaned my home prior to this. I bought nothing for this pandemic, I was cleaning prior and have supplies! It did not take me Covid 19 to buy bleach, soap & lysol!
@David Landers Research it. Bill Gates is behind it all. CORONAVIRUS that is being made in a lab is gonna be in the vaccine and contains HIV and SARS. Viruses are man made. The real coronavirus is weak is basically the common cold, look in the back of lysol disinfectants it shows that kills coronavirus, is been around for years. Is all a lie but some people have been indoctrinated by the news and media that they believe anything that they say. remember is called a television (tell lies in vision) go online and check how every virus has a patent, patent is when someone or some corp owns it, cause its been made. think about it. if the virus lives for 5 days the whole world is infected then. wake up. see the lies. and Turn to God cause whats happening is biblical. take care and be safe. blessing
@ddale8 To his supporters that already believe this is an old virus because: â€œsee, this can of Lysol says it is 99% effective against Coronavirus, checkmate Libsâ€ Trump claiming that Obama left him with obsolete and useless test is completely believesble to them.
 @DefargePenelope DC, Colorado, and Pennsylvania. NY is an outlier. Can the rest of us get back to work? If you feel sick, stay home. If you have a weakened health problemo, stay home. Can the rest of us go back to work now? Wash hands, donâ€™t touch face, #Lysol, blah blah #backtowork #coronavirus
@DevInTheLab Cause this â€œvirusâ€ ainâ€™t new. Itâ€™s been around before. Thatâ€™s why on Lysol cans it says coronavirus on there
@ECMcLaughlin I have Common Variable Immune Deficiency. My husband gets the mail each day, about an hour before the mailman arrives since 24 hours is long enough to kill coronavirus on cardboard/paper. He uses Lysol on everything, then lets it dry. You got this.

@Inevitable_ET Same with seasonal flu. Coronavirus is basically the flu. Lysol cans say it will kill those germs. COVID-19 is the more extreme version, attacking the lungs. It seems all of these 2 deaths combined, are being called Coronavirus, and not listed separately.
@ItsNorah88 @tacky_blue_suit @twirtz12473 @maladamus Ok, did a bit of digging i.e. googled it! Lysol protects against earlier known corona viruses, including common cold and flu. It has not yet been scientifically tested with the new corona virus #covid19. Soap DEFINITELY kills covid19. So does sanitiser with 60% or more alcohol.
@JackPosobiec Lysol & Clorox have been fighting coronavirus for years!
@JoeFMartin1 @FriendlyJMC @WitmerCarl @therealsusanq @sgtrocky27 @feingold32 @USMarine_Vet @carolina4POTUS @Catmandu50 @tony_sanky @OldManKowalski Excellent. Also, I might add, Coronavirus in different strains has been around for a while. I have a can of Lysol thatâ€™s at least 3 years old with coronavirus listed as something it kills. So a terminal cancer patient who contracts any corona on their deathbed will be counted. ðŸ¤”

@RealJamesWoods Why when you look on the back of the lysol can at the germs it kills is there a US patent symbol next to coronavirus?

@tacky_blue_suit @ItsNorah88 @twirtz12473 @maladamus The problem with the Lysol instructions, apparently, is that they refer to earlier corona viruses, not covid19. It may work, but it hasn't been tested yet. Soap DOES work cos it breaks apart the outer envelope of the virus and kills it. So soap is safer.
@thatuhohgirl @ViriMarquez @twirtz12473 @maladamus Yeah. You can use dish wash liquid or liquid soap, or soapy water. Lysol works for flu and cold corona virus, not yet proven for covid19. Soap is proven to kill covid19 by breaking apart the outer envelope of the virus.
@Trantor the Troll Its really hard to say but to be honest I think its fine to go grocery shopping but go early in the morning thats what me and my mom do then we lysol, take showers, etc. I clean every night eat the right foods be healthy.
@tyler_casper You scream coronavirus and mace them in the face with lysol ðŸ¤£
@Vej_Gee Everybody buying all the Lysol, and the funny thing is that according a a scientific report by John Hopkins, Lysol does not kill the Coronavirus. The outer layer can be melted by hot water and lots of soap, so it disintegrates.
@Vera Wallace Tell her to spray Lysol in the car service. I read Uber drivers have died. Car services might not be much safer than buses.
@xroads67 wrote: So...the problem is that sellers are making exorbitant amounts of money on something worth a few dollars, and people are paying this because of irrational fear and panic. (4 cans of Lysol sold for $3400.. ridiculous when bleach and water is just as effective) The reality is that a cloth mask is NOT going to prevent you from getting covid-19. You are more at risk from high touch surfaces and touching your face than you are from breathing it in. The cloth masks are better suited over an N95 for healthcare workers to extend the use of the N95 (and need I mention that an n95 and cloth masks are still not available to all healthcare workers partly because of a forum like this). If you really want to cover your face and feel that that protects you, you can use a bandana, a scarf, a balaclava etc. It's about as effective as a cloth mask. And yes, I do take this seriously. I'm a RN @xroads67 FIRST and foremost THANK YOU for your service. THANK YOU for caring for our family, friends and loved ones when we can not. THANK YOU for being so selfless that you are willing to put yourself in harms way to help others. THANK YOU!!! No that isn't it. Sellers do that all the time as do retail stores. But when we are in a National state of emergency, price gouging laws kick in. What some are doing is illegal as well as immoral. Banking money off the fears and needs of others in a crisis is a horrible thing to do on so many levels. But because some people don't have the ability to recognize this laws had to be passed to protect us all.
1. Wear face mask and glasses to protect mouth and eyes 2. Wear gloves, disinfect grocery cart, only carry one credit card, do not allow the cashier to touch credit card 3. Only go every 2 or 3 weeks and get there at the first minute of senior shopping with social distancing 4. Make a list, shop fast, get out of the grocery store fast 5. Put cardboard down in your trunk and put your groceries on that 6. Leave nonperishable groceries in the trunk for a few days 7. Leave your shoes in the garage 8. Wash/disinfect groceries before putting them away 9. Wash your hands before touching your groceries 10. Wash your mask every day 11. Only one person should go to the grocery store alone 12. Disinfect your door handles, steering wheel, spray Lysol on the bottom of your shoes Perhaps others could add their own helpful list of shopping suggestions to flatten the curve of coronavirus. Be caring, positive, and help everyone. ðŸ“ðŸ¥‘ðŸ¥¦ðŸðŸžðŸ¥•ðŸ…ðŸ’ðŸ‘ðŸ¥¨ðŸ¥â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
4 months ago I beat yâ€™all would have laughed if someone told you toilet paper, masks and Lysol spray would be the top selling products in 2020. #Coronavirus #COVID19
A Texas woman posted an anti-Covid19 rant on Facebook - "You don't need hand sanitizer & Lysol. You need common sense, faith, & of course guns!" Then she died of Covid19. The coronavirus was an opportunistic infection; the underlying cause of death was stupidity.
After seeing a video of a delivery guy spitting on a box he was delivering. I received a box yesterday, I had to spray it with lysol and keep it there unopened until I dont know when. #coronavirus

Deep_sleep said...Does anybody know if you can reuse surgical masks?When I search for it they say no."Simpler surgical face masks, made of a specialized paper-like material, should not be reused as they may capture and trap infected particles, nor can they be effectively washed or sanitized with any cleaning product."But as I have mail and groceries in a bag for 5 days before I touch them, I dont understand why that wont work here also.My plan is to have 30 masks so we can use one each every day for a week, then let them be in a paper bag for a week. Using these when going for a 30-40 min walk outside, saving the better masks for when I need to go in to a store.Your plan sounds logical! I have a few new N95's and some I used in my shop. And I have an an actual fitted respirator with screw on cartridge filters if the sh/t hits the fan. If I wore that, the whole store might evac, so works in two ways. (ha ha) Thing is, masks must fit tight around cheeks and nose to guard against airborne. Bad fitted masks will only work for direct spray (cough, sneeze ect.). Bearded guys must shave. Higher bridge noses are harder to fit.Some "authorities" dont like to elaborate on their answers, assuming the public is to stupid to understand, in fact, some of the public is actually smarter than the "authorities" (who are trained to repeat outdated info). If someone has less masks, placing them in a medium sized plastic bag (about 5-8 liters) after use, then sprayed with Lysol (North American brand disinfectant) with the bag tight around nozzle, could make them reusable in 36 hrs, as long as the mask is dry by then. Dont spray the mask directly. Use common sense. Disclaimers: If your sensitive to smells, dont do this. Masks even smell when new though.Try at own risk. We are now breathing at own risk. mpost Veteran Member Joined : Feb 2015 Posts : 1644 Posted Today 2:35 PM (GMT -6) according to stanford researchers u can sterilize n95 masks in 70C hot oven for 30min (they tested up to 20 times, may work for more but tests stopped at 20).

Hey, I'm trying to get an idea out to the public. Lysol kills Corona Virus. Get in a room spray a whole can. Sit down and breathe it in. (Not directly to the face) If a person can smell it and taste it then it's making it to the lungs. The virus cells grow on the outside of cells..? Doing this may destroy many of the virus cells. It could work. It may not work but it's worth a try. It must be tested and results of test made public for the rest of the world.

Hi Susan, Oh, that is a good idea â€“ setting aside a place to leave groceries that can be in room temperature for 3/4 days before having to bring them into the house.

It's also listed on the Lysol container, and NOT from this outbreak. SARS.. RT @Carroll_322: Thread. Coronavirus is old been around a long time. This version is a sophisticated Bioweapon created in the BSL 4 in Wuhan just a couple blocks from the wet market. It did not escape the lab but was intentionally released.
It's common courtesy to let them know before entering your apartment if you're sick, especially if you're contagious! We live in an apartment, have for many years, and whenever they need to enter the apartment for any reason, OR if we need to give them the rent check, we've let them know we've been sick and to take the precautions they need! They've let us know over and over how much they appreciate it! I know I'd like to know if I was the one having to be around someone that was sick! Since the corona virus came out and everyone is stuck at home, they sent out a letter saying that only emergency repairs will be done, then once the government says it's okay to return to work, they'll do all the non emergency repairs in the order they were reported. We also can't go into the office to pay the rent, we have to drop it in the door slot, which they probably spray with lysol before picking it up. Communication is by text or phone calls.

Ok so here we have a twist on coronavirus bs. Like it was made in a lab like hiv was. It is a hoax. It is a standard cold nothing more. Nothing new as it is on back of lysol cans for yrs RT @taiwanformosan: FBI Federal Agents arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard Universityâ€™s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying to the Department of Defense about secret monthly payments of $50,000.00 paid by China and receipt of millions more to help set up (1/3)

Chloriquine is a bit more harsh and both are very potent with Hydroxychloriquine being the less so both in harshness and potency--even so it still has a half-life of 40days in human body. THe couple realizing that indeed their aquarium cleaner had in it the active ingredient showing to be useful in fighting the covid-19 virus--they decided to get a jump start. The guy mixed up and entire pack of it and he and his wife drank it all. Its not like they drank lye--most likely the potency was much higher than prescription medicine or it included ingredients in addition to the chloriquine. The form they took is harsh. It has not been told what killed him...OverDose ..other ingredients added that are poison...allergic reactions. Very often medications for animals are nearly the same as for humans--but not always and needs properly researched...they didn't and paid a price. Not Trump's fault--ya can't fix stupid. Oh, I understand all of that. It might as well have been bleach. Just because something has an ingredient in it that is the same as some medicine, doesn't make it the same as medicine. The president was talking about medicine, not fish tank cleaner or bleach or lysol or any other disenfectant which would also be effective in eliminating the virus, but will kill you if you drink it. I'm missing the connection the OP is saying exists between what Trump said a couple of dumb dumbs drinking fish tank cleaner.

People Now Drinking LYSOL? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bR029VkqA&feature=youtu.be #coronavirus #covid19 #youtube @JeffreeStar #satire
People, if you love yourself, your loved ones, and your neighbor, WEAR A MASK!!!!! A brief conversation can result in sharing the Coronavirus. Someone delivers the groceries to your door; you meet them at the door without wearing a mask. You can get the virus from them even though you have carefully avoided going outside. You don't wipe off or spray with Lysol the delivered goods or packages, you touch your nose, mouth, or eyes, you get the virus. Be careful!!! God bless you and keep you safe.
Ppl you need to wake up is all virus is nothing but a viral pneumonia and they had to give a name Coronavirus but then ppl seen it on back of Lysol cans and then they chngd it to COVID19 but is the same thing and to scare ppl of how bad it is but really isn't. There's a virus.
Reina_Morena said: â†‘ Thank you! Disinfectant wipes are a waste. My only issue now is a replacement for lysol spray to spray porous surfaces. I'm using Pine Glo for that purpose. Most people aren't aware that it's the most cost-effective, American made cleaner that meets the scientific guidelines of killing the coronavirus. It's a North Carolina based company, and it's often sold in Wal Mart, Dollar General, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree. You can't beat a dollar for disinfectant that cleans.

Remember when all this BS started with Coronavirus until ppl started to slap it back in their face what Lysol killed on the back of the can. Then they changed it to COVID19. Ppl I'm Dave or David the same person just like Coronavirus & Covid-19 is the same thing.

smokey12 said: â†‘ Forget the showers and bathrooms. Get your 5 gallon bucket with toilet lid and diaper wipes for wipes down ##### baths. Going in these nasty places right now is not worth the risk. Yall know a lot of times these folks wipe the bathrooms down with the used dirty butt juice towels and spray here and there..forget it...nope not now I still use truck stop showers. I just spray everything with Lysol multi surface cleaner/disinfectant. I only had to go to 8 different walmarts in five different states before I could find a bottle of it.
So based on the stores. We got a bunch of people working out with dumbbells to work off the bread they ate. Then crapping constantly and finishing it off by wiping with Lysol wipes and then hand sanitizing and making nothing but proteins for dinner. FFS #COVID19
So the #Lysol can already on the back it has: SARS Coronavirus. On the kills in minutes section. WTF man! This shyt has been out for years maybe even decades. #CoronavirusPandemic
So we finally had groceries delivered over Instacart yesterday. It was actually a great experience. We ordered about 40 different items (bill was around $250 total) and got basically everything we asked for or acceptable alternatives instead. My experience using the app was great. I've heard stories about people waiting for their orders and having it canceled last minute, but that wasn't our experience. I placed my order around 3PM yesterday and had everything delivered to me by 5:30. All the food was brought to our garage and we set up a folding table to disinfect items before bringing them in the house like that video suggested. I basically soaked a rag with Lysol and wiped everything down, while my wife would transport clean items back inside the house. We also had filled a giant plastic bowl with warm soapy water and let all our fruit and vegetables soak in there while we dealt with the rest of the stuff. The entire thing took us about 40-45 minutes. It was tiring, but we felt like it was worth it to have that piece of mind and while you're busy doing it it's not like you're thinking about how time-consuming it is, you're just thinking about getting it all cleaned. We also ordered enough groceries where we'll be pretty well-stocked for at least a couple of months. There was a lot of debate about whether this is worth it or not. For us it absolutely was. Again if you're buying in bigger quantities you're only going to have clean like this one every month or two.
So...the problem is that sellers are making exorbitant amounts of money on something worth a few dollars, and people are paying this because of irrational fear and panic. (4 cans of Lysol sold for $3400.. ridiculous when bleach and water is just as effective) The reality is that a cloth mask is NOT going to prevent you from getting covid-19. You are more at risk from high touch surfaces and touching your face than you are from breathing it in. The cloth masks are better suited over an N95 for healthcare workers to extend the use of the N95 (and need I mention that an n95 and cloth masks are still not available to all healthcare workers partly because of a forum like this). If you really want to cover your face and feel that that protects you, you can use a bandana, a scarf, a balaclava etc. It's about as effective as a cloth mask. And yes, I do take this seriously. I'm a RN
Spray them with Lysol! In there mouth if they can't cover it.you may get fired but hey! Do what you gotta do
Still no masks, no hand sanitizer, no Lysol wipes. Still just a measly $5 phone credit to make up for being totally cut off from their families. https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/jge4yy/canadas-prisons-are-a-coronavirus-time-bomb-say-guards-and-inmates
Thank you! @paulsperry_ We, as just regular Americans, ARE SICK TO DEATH OF New York being said to be example of America! ðŸ˜ ARE THEY NUTS? We wouldn't go there wrapped n cellophane with a can of Lysol n each hand even before the WUHAN VIRUS Pandemic! @NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump RT @paulsperry_: Gov. Cuomo is mistaken when he says New York is a "microcosm" of America, and that as NY goes with COVID-19 outbreak, so goes the rest of the country. For starters, New York is magnet for foreign travelers spreading the virus & what's more, people live on top of each other in NYC
That is not even remotely what I said. I said eBay and @AGBecerra are cracking down on price gouging - thatâ€™s it, thatâ€™s the story. Iâ€™ll be clear about this, though: I do not support cans of Lysol selling for $1300. I think thatâ€™s bad. I would like for that to not happen. RT @LeroyGrider: @MarieEdinger So you are in support of the government deciding who gets a mask and who doesn't? How long will that take? How many meetings? https://reason.com/2020/03/16/price-gouging-laws-will-do-more-harm-than-good-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/
The EPA released a list of products that are effective for use against SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Some Clorox and Lysol products are on the list, but so are dozens of others.

There is too much ridiculousness to respond to each person individually so I'll just blanket response here. NO ONE IS SAYING YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE A BABY SHOWER EVER. We're saying that we're sick of the people that are trying to have one for the sole purpose of getting gifts. IMO (in my opinion) there are many more important things happening in the world right now than a baby shower. People are struggling right now. I could not try to have a virtual shower without worrying about others. I think about my sister in law who lost her job due to coronavirus and the fact that she would love nothing more than to shower her first niece, but can't. I think about my mom's best friend who lost her mother last week and can't have a funeral for her- that the "virtual" celebration can be a trigger since the "funeral" was "virtual". I think about my mom friends that have become homeschool teachers overnight and how them trying to figure out how to add attend a shower/get a present to their already insane lives seems like an inconvenience. The other problem is that people aren't taking this virus seriously. The dropping off baby showers favors can potentially spread the virus. Having people come to your home to drop off presents can potentially spread the virus. Basically, unless you are having ZERO REAL CONTACT with people YOU CAN SPREAD THE VIRUS. There are things we can't avoid (like grocery shopping) but anything "non-essential" can wait. I honestly even lysol amazon packages rights now. Do I wish I could have a shower? Yes. Would gifts have been wonderful and helpful no matter how financially secure we are? Absolutely. Can I figure out the essentials and wait to celebrate? Yes and so can you.

There shouldn't be a tp shortage. Mask shortage. Hand sanitizer, Lysol shortage. Corps of Engineers should be on those industries as much as anything else, lest this get even worse. The POTUS saying something and a CEO making excuses isn't good enough. #coronavirus
There was silence. No one spoke. The sun was shining, yet the air seemed heavy. I wondered, â€œIs this what rationing feels like?â€ As I neared the entrance, I was offered a Lysol sprayed shopping cart. #COVID19 #groceryshopping #Flowers https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3394833517198996&set=a.613350102014032&type=3&theater

This is true for some viruses and bacteria but covid-19 can be broken down by alcohol or soap quickly. If you're concerned about, say, salmonella, then yes--leave it on the surface for a while. Bleach water works well, too, and is cheaper. RT @katienotopoulos: I was horrified to learn while writing this that Lysol wipes only work if they keep a surface wet enough that it stays wet for 4 minutes https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/how-to-plague-advice-on-laid-off-friends-gift-cards-and
This was the most terrorfying video I've ever seen on the internet. @PBCountySheriff & @PalmSpringsPD do you really support that view? Send drones or the bomb disposal robots & strap mobile phones to it. Take a @Lysol wipe, clean the phone, & there you go. RT @tomselliott: SUPERCUT! Dems give really terrible Coronavirus advice
This year's hottest fragrance is Eau du Lysol. Supplies are already limited, it is flying off the shelves & purchases may be restricted in your area! Remember friends, nothing is sexier in 2020 than the clean & sanitized smell of Eau Du Lysol. #covid19 #sanitizer

To the people of the United States of America. Who would have thought a virus that originated out of China could disrupt every basic function in our lives? Trump you and your moronic Administration has brought America down to its knees. What's frightening to most American people, there is no light at the end of this coronavirus tunnel vision. Trump you could not answer a simple question from a reporter, what do the president of the United States of America has to say to the people that are frightened? Then you turn around and give the reporter a psychotic answer. Suddenly Lysol wipes toilet paper are a rare commodity hand sanitizer maybe more valuable then money itself. Trump you will never break the will of the real American people because the real American people now realize that there are some people in this country that are just is moronic as you , starting with you, and ending with the Republican Party and let me speak for the American people together we will endure as President Theodore Roosevelt said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and the American people do not fear you and your moronic Republicans.
todos los potes que Lysol que llevan aÃ±os en casa dicen â€œcoronavirusâ€
Told y'all at the break of this coronavirus...sanitize your paper and coin money. Spray that stuff with Lysol and put it in a Ziploc bag for 24-48 hours...or something like that. Money was disgusting BEFORE COVID19 m'kay...um hello y'all do remember cocaine and strippers right?

u know what would be a good idea? If the govt decided to send a mass chain message thru fb that we have to send to 10 other ppl saying to close the door & windows so helicopters can just spray copious amounts of Lysol & defeat Covid-19
Was searching through the EPA database that details how long it takes cleaners to kill #coronavirus, was shocked to see things like Lysol Spray actually require the surface to be *wet* with the cleaner for 2min to actually kill the the virus. Keep this in mind when cleaning.
We canâ€™t even get Lysol. RT @rhettmc: If the blood of Jesus proves to be an effective treatment against COVID-19, people are just gonna start hoarding it.
We have a hard getting it done because we canâ€™t get the right supplies. No alcohol, no Lysol, no bleach, no dawn, no soap. So what do we use? Listerene? Ever Clear? RT @CDCgov: Stop the spread of #COVID19 while working from home. Clean & then disinfect surfaces such as tables, desks, phones, tablets, & keyboards. For electronic devices, follow manufacturer instructions or use alcohol-based sprays containing at least 70% alcohol. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-your-home.html
We just have to organize our own strike. I will post again that it has been ignored that they closed the schools too late and made us come in to virus infested buildings that they lied about cleaning. We were made to be in close quarters, no Lysol, no supplies, no ventilation, no windows, etc. And we were made to use our days to travel in and put our health and lives at risk. DISGUSTED!!!!!! Get our days back for that period of time. Don't let them use it to discipline anyone. With or without a doctor note it was against scientific, CDC, OSHA, and common sense guidelines to go in to work. We are not first responders! While the mayor sat there directing people not to gather, we were forced to gather. Wtf. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nyc-teacher-coronavirus_n_5e711f76c5b60fb69ddf6d02
Went to the grocery store today. First time since before the great toilet paper stampede a few weeks back. It's surreal seeing all the empty shelves. One thing to read about it quite another to see it first hand. We aren't ever going back to normal. Quoting: Nefarious Libertine Yeah, I made a run to Aldi, Walmart and Home Depot today. Burned through 3 1/2 pair of gloves (used only one while filling up with $1.29/gallon gas) 3 masks, several Lysol wipes (a few more decontaminating our goods), and half a small bottle of hand sanitizer. Every store limited the amount of people inside, so there were long lines outside each (I ensured proper distancing was maintained in front and behind me.) The food shelves were terribly bare...meat was pathetic. It was a nice day, so the worst line was Home Depot. Iâ€™m very close to all these stores, but the normally 2 hour trip took nearly 4. It was a strange, surreal visit in a month or so of surreal visits.

whaaaâ€¦ has anyone else looked at the back of their Lysol disinfectant spray and noticed that its says it disinfects against the Coronavirus? #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19Pandemic
When someone sneezes and they leave a room it's amazing to actually see the vapor left behind in the room! makes me want to walk around with a can of lysol for the rest of my life!!!! Schitt -- I'mma die from acute Lysol intoxication! Eff all this bool!!!

A group of officials stand in front of beds at Moscone West in San Francisco, Thursday, April 2, 2020. Since the beginning of the international pandemic, officials in California have said one population is particularly vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus and spreading it to others: the homeless. Officials are setting up 400 beds at the Moscone Center to house homeless people who are currently in shelters to allow for more social distancing. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Since the beginning of an international pandemic, experts have known one population is particularly vulnerable to contracting and spreading the coronavirus: the homeless. Officials have vowed repeatedly to get them indoors, but testing shortages and bureaucratic wrangling are making it difficult. Relatively few of Californiaâ€™s 150,000 homeless have been moved into individual quarters. Itâ€™s unclear how many even have the highly contagious virus. â€œThe whole shelter-in-place and the whole lack of shelter-in-place for homeless people was totally poorly thought out,â€ said Needa Bee, who lives in a camper in Oakland with her teenage daughter. The shutdown of public libraries and other facilities has made it difficult for homeless people to get clean water and food or use the bathroom. Itâ€™s a struggle playing out nationwide. In Portland, Oregon, some will be housed in the retro-hip Jupiter Hotel. In Seattleâ€™s King County, authorities bought a motel and leased another to take infected people, with plans to move hundreds of homeless people from shelters into hotel rooms next week. Photos of homeless people in Las Vegas â€” a city brimming with hotels â€” temporarily sleeping on rectangles painted on a makeshift parking lot sparked outrage. The Trump administration announced $3 billion Thursday for homelessness pandemic efforts. California Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged $150 million in homeless aid, including money for hotel rooms. He was expected to announce more steps Friday. Mary Kate Bacalao, policy director at Compass Family Services in San Francisco, called the situation â€œabsolutely terrifying.â€ â€œThe urgency of this, and the urgency to get people inside, now more than ever cannot be overstated,â€ she said. â€œWeâ€™re moving way too slowly.â€ Some San Francisco supervisors want more aggressive action to move people off the streets, while the mayor is focusing on people already in shelters or those showing symptoms. â€œWe have the hotel rooms, we have the money, we have the staffing. â€¦ Why wouldnâ€™t we do this right now and save thousands of lives?â€ Supervisor Hillary Ronen said Thursday. Mayor London Breed says itâ€™s not so easy in a population where many struggle with mental illness or addictions. â€œI know that people are asking, â€˜Well, why donâ€™t we just open the doors and let everyone whoâ€™s homeless get access to a hotel room?â€™â€ Breed said. â€œWe donâ€™t have the ability to force anyone to stay anywhere.â€ The coronavirus has infected more than 11,000 Californians and killed at least 249 as of Friday, according a tally by Johns Hopkins University. For most people, COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For others, it can cause more severe illness such as pneumonia, or death. Among the California deaths was a crew member aboard the Grand Princess ship now docked in San Francisco Bay. Princess Cruises confirmed the death Friday. Spokesperson Negin Kamali did not answer questions about the workerâ€™s home country, what will happen to the crew still aboard the ship or where the ship is headed when it leaves its current location Saturday. At least two others tied to the ship have died after becoming infected during a voyage to Hawaii. In San Jose, Phil Mastrocola, who runs a shelter at Grace Baptist Church, said homeless people want more information, such as how to tell if they are sick and where to go. â€œIf youâ€™re telling people not to go the hospital, where do they go?â€ he said. San Diego County has been among the most proactive, sending outreach teams with nurses to distribute hygiene kits and focusing first on people who want help getting into a hotel. About 300 high-risk homeless people have moved into some of the 2,000 hotel rooms. â€œOnce we plow through the thousands of people who are accepting our help weâ€™ll be forced to deal with that stickier situation,â€ San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher said. Needa Bee is the founder of a grassroots collective that administers to roughly 40 Oakland homeless encampments. Theyâ€™ve been asking for donations of lemons and vinegar to sanitize hands since bleach and Lysol are so hard to get, distributing raw garlic for an immune boost, and collecting aloe plants to make hand sanitizer. Compass Family Shelter raised private money to pay for a six-night hotel stay for a family who had to leave a shelter while waiting for their daughterâ€™s COVID-19 test results, which were negative. The family left Monday and canâ€™t be reached. Caseworkers are also trying desperately to reach a woman who recently gave birth to a baby with medical issues. They didnâ€™t initially have a room for her. â€œWe lose these windows of opportunity when we donâ€™t have the flexibility to say yes quickly,â€ Bacalao said.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) â€” Itâ€™s no secret phones can get pretty dirty over time. Whatever you touch with your hands â€“ food, bacteria, dust â€” can be transferred to your cell phone making it a mobile petri dish. So how do you keep your phones clean and sanitized in the age of the coronavirus? The good news is that disinfecting your electronic device has officially become easier. Apple says on its website that you can safely clean your iPhone with disinfectant wipes, like Clorox sheets. Samsung added to its website you can use an alcohol-based solution (70%) and apply it to your phone with a soft microfiber cloth. Donâ€™t use rubbing alcohol. Straight alcohol could damage your phone. The safest bet is disinfectant wipes that contain 70% isopropyl alcohol.

Iâ€™m not too informed about this so if Iâ€™m wrong please correct me. Lysol would be like a hand sanitizer, it sanitizes by being applied.

Dollar General on South Main Street, Greensburg, displays a sign indicating that the store is out of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, Lysol and most cleaning supplies. Updated less than a minute ago Iâ€™m not sure whether covid-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in the U.S. qualifies as a true disaster. Putting the disease in perspective, we might look at current influenza illnesses. According to Centers for Disease Control estimates, between Oct. 1, 2019, and March 14, 2020, there have been 390,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations as a result of the flu, 38 million to 54 million flu illnesses and 23,000 to 59,000 flu deaths. Thatâ€™s compared with, as of April 2, a total of 213,144 cases of covid-19 resulting in the deaths of 4,513 people. But letâ€™s agree that covid-19 is a disaster and ask what the appropriate steps that are to deal with it. One of the first observations about any disaster is that the quantity demanded of many goods greatly exceeds the supply. There is a shortage. The natural market response when there is a shortage is for prices to rise. Rising prices produce several beneficial effects. They reduce the incentive for people to hoard while suppliers, motivated by the prospect of higher profits, are incentivized to produce more of the good in short supply. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia have anti-price gouging laws that prohibit â€œexcessive and unjustifiedâ€ increases in prices of essential consumer goods and services during a federal, state or local declared emergency. Price gouging is legally defined as charging 10% to 25% more for something than you charged for it during the month before an emergency. Sellers convicted of price gouging face stiff fines and perhaps prison terms. But what about hoarding? Often hoarding creates the shortage. In uncertain times, people may purchase three dozen eggs instead of one dozen. They may want to maintain stockpiles of canned goods and buy up large quantities of cleaners, paper towels and toilet paper. This kind of behavior has left some with overflowing freezers, shelves of sanitizers and garages full of toilet paper while their neighbors are left either wanting for the same items or paying what some call â€œexcessive and unjustifiedâ€ prices. While itâ€™s difficult to get beyond emotions, the fact is that consumers are not forced to buy products for the higher (gouged) price. If they pay, it is likely because they see themselves as being better off acquiring the good than the alternative â€” keeping their money in their pocket. Higher prices charged have a couple of unappreciated benefits. First, they get people to economize on the use of the good whose price has risen. That is higher prices reduce demand and encourage conservation. That helps with the disaster. With higher prices, profit-seeking suppliers know that they can make more money by bringing additional quantities of the goods to the market. This increases the supply of goods, which helps to drive prices back down. Anti-price gouging laws disrupt these two very important functions of the marketplace and enhance and prolong a disaster. In other words, in a disaster, we want people to economize their use of goods and services and we want suppliers of these goods and services to produce more. Rising prices encourage these actions. Anti-price gouging laws stymy those incentives and create the pretense that a disaster does not exist. Some people might reluctantly agree that allowing prices to rise during a disaster helps allocate resources. But theyâ€™ll complain thatâ€™s not the intention of greedy sellers who are out to profit. I say, so what? Itâ€™s not sellersâ€™ intentions that count but what their actions accomplish thatâ€™s important â€” namely, getting people to conserve more and suppliers to produce more. Many of the problems associated with a disaster would be eliminated if peopleâ€™s buying behavior were the same as it was before the disaster. To get people to behave nicely and consider their neighbors is the ultimate challenge. I think rising prices are the best and most dependable way to get people to be considerate of their fellow man.

Honestly a bleach water mix is your best bet for wiping stuff down. The ratio is on the WHO site, I don't remember what the wife said it was. The mixture kill the virus on contact compared to lysol wipes etc that take up to 10 minutes. This came form the wife after the health inspector showed up and said keep it up.

Howâ€™s it all going in your homes? I bet theyâ€™ve never been so tidy. More importantly how are you getting on with your â€œBubble familyâ€? Itâ€™s very easy to start getting on each otherâ€™s nerves. Trust me I know, especially when you are also working from home too. Michael and I are stressing each other out about how clean we are. Neither of us dare sneeze or we are in for a dousing of Lysol spray. When we go out itâ€™s like we are preparing for battle. Gloves on, masks on, Glasses on â€“ Purell at the ready â€“ letâ€™s go supermarket shopping! Even though there are two of us in the house we thought it might be okay to have my sister-in-law and niece come around for dinner each night, seeing they had been self-isolating for two weeks too at this point, but one of our community, namely Marina Paganucci â€“informed me during last weekâ€™s virtual Brits Brekkie Club â€“ that its a big no-no. She had consulted her family practitioner and quickly shut it down. This despite the fact that we make them take off their shoes and wash their hands upon entry and we eat six feet apart. I guess we were still taking a risk, so we have decided to be smarter now and not have them come round for dinner until all this is over. You are all welcome to take part in Viritual Brits Brekkie via the Zoom app â€“ and you never know what you might learn from others in the community. (Thanks, Marina!) I asked our Facebook group how they have been spending their time during this shelter in place period â€“ some people have been following in my footsteps (check me out on IG @colintheraverâ€™s) by creating content for Instagram stories. Special mention must go to Nick Hardcastle (@nickcastlehard) who is re-creating recently canceled public events, He started with Prom2020 â€“ From the date to the dance to the dinner â€“ which is a hoot all the way and now heâ€™s in the middle of #limpics2020 â€“ the curling and wrestling are pure gems â€“ and host Nicky No Pants is a real treat. Scott Urner @scottdotcom has created QUARANFREE (right) A comedy jaunt of tips to cope through these mad times. Jonathan Jude has created a series called â€œHappy Epidemicâ€ on youtube. A more dark comedy, on how self-isolation can really start to mess with your social skills. Katyâ€™s 16 year old is handling by creating THINGS MOMS SAY DURING QUARANTINE also on YouTube. For you creative types I have partnered with our own Elizabeth Arends on The Lockdown Fiom Festival. Submit your two minute shorts. Itâ€™s just for fun, but winners get toilet paper â€“ come on we all know we need it! Find it on FilmFreeway.com and search for Lockdownlogon. We canvassed various BiLA members to see how they were getting on during this challenging time, hereâ€™s a few of our replies: Dan is studying to do a TED TALK. Valerie is trying to keep productive, by creating a new routine, but is thankful for her cats for company. Meanwhile Natalie is awaiting the birth of her second child on April 6th. I heard some places in the world arenâ€™t allowing more than one person to be present during the birth. So we wish you well Natalie. Some of us already have their young â€˜uns at home. And Shayne, mum to an 18-month says that other than going to the park to play, everything is still much the same, unlike Lucy, who is working from home and has two very young children in the middle of potty training â€“ so you can imagine how fun zoom video conferencing is going to be. Samantha is eating Oreos, a lot of them. Miranda has a stranger delivering some random acts of kindness, by leaving TP on her doorstep. Sarah is even more productive, working on her fitness biz and accompanying fitness videos. On the other hand Yadani has created a home spa â€“ I can relate to this â€“ Iâ€™ve been spending more and more time in the bathtub, (a small 1/2 sized bathtub may I add), pondering whether to stay in till I shrivel up or get out and lather myself in Purell again. Kerry has two boys, a house to keep and a bottle of alcohol, another Kerry also with two young boys is feeling blessed as her community has gathered around and helped after her husband had been diagnosed with COVID-19. And a lot of hospitals have canceled regular surgeries, affecting thousands â€“ including Roland â€™s girlfriend who was supposed to have breast cancer surgery. Like everyone else who is suffering during these times our hearts go out to you and your loved ones. Love, Craig Young

@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Rep Scalise. Is it possible ? That in the last 2 yrs the flu shots has Coronavirus mixed in ? If itâ€™s True ? Should the Dr ask the question about the patient history if they received the shot ? 2nd . Why does the Lysol Products state it kills Coronavirus ? I donâ€™t get it?
Victor Keith Mattison he didnâ€™t. He had a conference and ended up telling America to go out and get water, Gatorade and Lysol because the Corona Virus is on its way to America. I listened because I had all my supplies 2 weeks before everyone went crazy when the virus already arrived here. Nobody listened to him. I did and was well prepared for this!!!!!
Rhonda Johnson if you all read up on things, the bacteria is heavy. When someone coughs, It falls to the ground. You walk right on it and then go home and take your shoes off. Not washing your hands afterwards and end up touching your face one way or another, you have CoronaVirus!!!!! It doesnâ€™t stay lingering in the air like others do. Lysol your shoes when you get home and hand sanitizer after that!!!!
@WhiteHouse ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸POTUS â­ï¸ Ask ? Who ? Did the last flu shots have Coronavirus in the mix ? Ask ? Who ? Why Lysol products on the label it will kill Coronavirus . Even on dated products ? How is that ? The Military Dr . Need to know if the patients had Flu shots ? There you go ? Hmm ?

@Corrynmb The virus is real. Coronavirus has been around for years. Its even listed on the back of a lysol can. This variant has a twist. All that said, the Dems have weaponized it, the media is driving panic for ratings. And what is the best way to control people - fear of the unknown.
All correct, with only one exception. There is a vaccine for SARS. Which is a reason to be very optimistic and hopeful about the probability that one will be developed for this new virus. Coronaviruses are so common that if you look on the back of a container of Clorox disinfecting wipes HUMAN CORONAVIRUS is one of the bugs they specifically list as something they will disinfect/kill.

wish I could put the pictures of the Lysol spray bottles I pulled out the back of my cabinet that were like 6 years old you know they clearly have coronavirus on them and that means this was clearly something before this president so before everyone plays the blame game ask the cdc why they never made a vaccine and the senate why they did nothing at all but donâ€™t blame each president as they step up and not one working for free for god sakes people he also is getting no funding for his workers at his own business he has to pay for them himself on top of being the president for free so why is he being blamed when he is being told what to say to the people and fighting for the people and businesses to have something and heâ€™s getting nothing out of all of this nothing but just trying to help some how he was just as blind sided . Thatâ€™s all I have to say. Read your Lysol cans youâ€™ll know the truth then and who is lying to you.

(KRON) â€” The coronavirus pandemic has set many people back, but we have also seen people band together in this time of need. Hand sanitizer, face masks, and gloves are just a few of the essential items that have been depleted during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jennifer Arrouzet, owner of Cafe Soleil in El Sobrante has stepped up to do her part. â€œWe just decided from day one that we were going to rally the community, rally our friends, rally our business contacts, people weâ€™ve catered for to just help donate masks, donate gloves, donate, sanitizer,â€ Arrouzet said. Jennifer and her husband have accepted donations to buy products, but theyâ€™ve also exhausted all personal resources as well. â€œWe couldnâ€™t even get lysol wipes because all of the supplies were gone. My restaurant suppliers canâ€™t get them in,â€ she said. â€œSo I have been calling Costco, saying hey I have been your customer for 28 years can you send some for me. So we started buying all that we could and giving them to the hospitals because it was that desperate.â€ Their business has taken a big hit, but that isnâ€™t a direct concern at the moment. â€œWe went from up here to here, overnight 95-percent down. But itâ€™s OK because I am not worried about where we are going to be in a month or two months when we get back open,â€ Arrouzet said. â€œI honestly believe when you take care of your community and your workers, your community is going to take care of you. And itâ€™s already happening and I already see it. We donâ€™t have as much as we did, but whatever we have we are going to keep giving.â€

CDC has informed and knows that the virus does not last very long on surfaces. You can just not touch it and wash your hands after setting it down for a few hours to a full day until the virus dries up and dies. Wipe the cover well with a disinfectant wipe (lysol or clorox wipe) and you can use a clorox or lysol or any disinfectant spray to fan through the pages and spray them lighty with a disinfectant spray. Be careful with bleach based sprays, they could damage the book by removing the ink.Â Or you can just throw it out and get a new one. If you choose to dispose of it be sure to seal it in it's own plastic air-tight bag to lock any contaminents on it in so it doesn't have the possability of infecting anyone.
Just give it a light spray with Lysol or any type of aerosol disinfectant.
An isolation unit and quarantine site is being set up at the MetraPark Pavilion, according to Yellowstone County's United Health Command. The site will be for those awaiting COVID-19 testing results or who have tested positive. The site is planned specifically for those who are homeless or experiencing domestic violence and have not other accommodation. "While the best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is for everyone to stay home, wash their hands frequently and maintain a 6-foot distance from others, this is impossible for people who do not have somewhere to shelter-in-place," the group said in press briefing materials. The Unified Health Command involves communication, planning and meetings among RiverStone Health, Billings Clinic, St. Vincent Healthcare and Yellowstone County Disaster and Emergency Services. The MetraPark site for patients will be staffed by medical, mental health and substance abuse professionals from a variety of organizations, Yellowstone County Health Officer John Felton said. While the site was originally planning to begin operating Monday, he said plans changed and officials began using it Thursday night, although he declined to say how many patients were currently being sheltered there. The site will be able to serve "several dozens" of patients at a time, Felton said. Both Felton and KC Williams, the county's emergency services director, stressed that the MetraPark site is only for those individuals awaiting test results, or who have a confirmed positive COVID-19 test result, and lack proper housing. â€œThis is not an overflow shelter,â€ Felton said. The site will use Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and $50,000 from St. Vincent Healthcare Foundation, according to the UHC. A separate building at MetraPark, the Sandstone Building, will be used to accept and process donations. The command is asking for donations of personal protective equipment. Anyone with donations should call ahead to schedule their drop-off at 406-208-8154. Requested items are: N95 respirators:1860, 8210, Inovell 3000 and 1870, 1870+, 9210, 9211, 8511Z. Surgical masks, including ASTM levels 1, 2 and 3. Hand sanitizer (70% alcohol preferred). Tyvek overalls. Tyvek hoods. Face shields. Thermometers: oral (digital) and no touch. Goggles (no splash preferred). Disinfectants (Fuzion item No. 31478), Caviwipes, Clorox/Lysol disinfecting wipes. Isolation gowns (Fluid resistant). Officials are asking that items be brought in their original packaging if possible, and otherwise labeled and well organized in a sturdy box, with the name and number of each item listed. The donation center began operating on Friday. Instructions for cash donations will be provided at a later date, according to the command. In addition to donations, the command is asking for health care volunteers. Any retired doctors, nurses, social workers, administrators, medical assistants and similar occupations are encouraged to donate their time and expertise. For more information or to volunteer, call 406-272-8511 or visit youcanvolunteer.org Recommended for you

For God's sakes, would somebody please discuss how to clean them? Not all types can go in the wash. Some people are advising putting Lysol on them; but I think that would poison people. Some people say to freeze them; but that does NOT hurt the virus. I think you can microwave them, if they don't have metal. PLEASE TELL US! The lack of relevant information produces as much stress as the virus. We need to UNDERSTAND things, so we can sort out the false information from the true information. We need more than simple steps, because there will be no way to tell what is incorrect advice. Help us UNDERSTAND. Help us UNDERSTAND.

Trump???s ???Hospital worker stolen masks??? Found, in Massive alleged Hasidic Stockpile Seized by FBI Trump wrongly blamed hospital employees for stealing THESE SAME FACE MASKS https://www.veteranstoday.com/2020/04/02/trumps-hospital-worker-stolen-masks-found-in-massive-alleged-hasidic-stockpile-seized-by-fbi/ Trump accused New York hospital workers of stealing hundreds of thousands of face masks. The FBI started grilling doctors and nurses, but then the truth finally came out and the FBI, quite properly, acted. Lo and behold, whoodathunkit: A Brooklyn man claiming to be infected with the coronavirus coughed on FBI agents who were investigating him for hoarding medical supplies, the US Attorney???s Office said Monday. Baruch Feldheim, 43, is facing charges of assault and making false statements to the feds on Sunday outside his Borough Park home where he allegedly peddled and stored massive amounts of N95 respirator masks, federal officials said. Feldheim is also accused of price-gouging. On March 18, he???s suspected of selling a New Jersey doctor about 1,000 of the masks for $12,000, a markup of roughly 700 percent, authorities said. The accused fraudster also directed another doctor to an Irvington, NJ, auto repair shop to pick up another order. There, the doctor reported to investigators that Feldheim was allegedly hoarding enough medical supplies ???to outfit an entire hospital.??? The materials included hand sanitizers, Clorox wipes, chemical cleaning agents and surgical supplies. By last Monday, Feldheim was operating from his Brooklyn home, offering to push surgical gowns to a nurse, the feds said. Two days later, the suspected hoarder received a gigantic shipment at his home of about eight pallets of face masks. FBI agents then staked out his house, first noticing empty boxes of N95 masks outside. New York Post: On Sunday, they said they witnessed ???multiple instances??? of people approaching Feldheim???s residence and walking away with what appeared to be medical supplies. The agents confronted Feldheim outside his house, keeping a safe social distance over coronavirus fears. ???When the agents were within four to five feet of him, Feldheim allegedly coughed in their direction without covering his mouth,??? the US attorney???s release said. ???At that point, Feldheim told the FBI agents that that he had the Coronavirus,??? the statement said. Feldheim then allegedly lied to FBI agents regarding his possession and sale of medical supplies. He falsely told the agents that he worked for a company that bought and sold PPE and that he never took physical custody of the materials. Following Feldheim???s arrest, the FBI on Monday night raided a warehouse on Pennsylvania Avenue in an industrial section of Linden, NJ, that housed Feldhim???s suspected stash of 80,000 masks, a source said. Feldheim is a Jew and was hoarding these for the Hasidic Jewish community. Hasidic Jews are ultra-conservative and take the "Chosen people" thing to insane levels, so much so that in Israel they don't even serve in the IDF, yet they apparently don't care about non-Jews dying as this story shows. Never share with the goyim or with the needy.
Lysol is killing the Ozone.. and the future for our kids..
ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”Has anyone ever stop to even look up the word Coronavirus or did you just look up Cov-19 which by the way has been around forever in and is just another word for germs in fact of all the strands Cov-19 is the weakest one. You have to understand that in China there are over 1.386 billion people the largest in the world while in the USA is only 327 million and also China is a communist government they are not even allowed to have facebook YouTube or the same internet access the government even dictates the news so how do you keep over a billion people under control the answer is fear every year there is a new virus that's how they control them they don't even think it's safe to breath the air they are always wearing mask they have no idea what corona viruses are accept what they are told but for all you people in the USA there is no excuse for being a dumb ass the government is counting on that everyone who has ever used a bottle of bleach pinesole Lysol or ammonia should know about corona viruses there is no new strand they are just tiny germs most of which is already in your DNA which is why everyone is testing positive for it and they kill people every year usually those who are really old and have a weak immune system like HIV or Aids. The hospitals and doctors are just doing what the United States Surgeon general is telling them to do and the surgeon general answers to the president. Trump is just trying to close down trade with China and bring back Jobs to the US and as he says make America great again and Italy Canada and others are doing the same by using China's ploy against them. Think about it everything you wear and use cellphones appliances cars (most of MC Donald's and other corporations) is owned or made in China. China is on the brink of owning the USA and most of the world which is why Trump and these other countries are doing this while you are at home shopping online you are only buying reserves companies in China that use to be USA based are bleeding millions by the day every day of this Cov shutdown and soon it will be billions forcing them to come back to the USA or go to India where the US is setting up for manufacturing and distribution.But what about the news you ask first of all when was the last time the communist government of China has allowed any news into their country and to report a crisis the news is reporting what they are told to report most of the content comes from enemies of the state of China do we allow the news media to come into the hospitals here in the USA no so why would a communist government do it? Most of these news Apps on your phones are just college kids feeding the beast and you are paying for their college and making some very rich right now. Governments will always tell you what ever it takes to get you to do what they want like global warming and saying there's a hole in the ozone. Can you put a hole in the air? Can you put a hole in water? Can you put a hole in gas are oxygen?NOOOOOO thats what the atmosphere is made of . And even if you could the temperature of space is absolute zero thats below freezing cold in the winter time when you are driving with the heat on what happens when you rolled the window down does it get hotter no Cold air comes in so what do you think would happen to the earth if the ozone layer was thinning. Scientist know this they also say that there's global warming and the icecaps or melting and the water is rising but what's really happening is the Earths distance between the sun and moon is constantly changing as it orbits the sun the distance between these celestial bodies effect climate change and the water and tides are effected by the moon's gravitational forces also known as tidal forces as the earth's distance gets closer to the Sun it gets warmer melting icecaps but these will freeze up again when the distance changes some changes occur within human lifespans which is why you see lunar and solar eclipses every 360 to 460 year in different parts of the world and that why ten years ago you might have gotten ten feet of snow and years later six inches scientist know all of this but they tell you that there is global warming so you will be scared and there's a hole in the ozone layer. They do this because political parties pay them so that when its time for a presidential election and they say they are going to stop global warming you will vote for them and they then pay these scientist more funding for their research (Bribery) that's all thats happening now the communist government of China is counting on ignorance,stupidity and fear to control 1.386 billion people in China and Trump Europe and Canada is counting on you to be that dumb as well so they can end Chinas economic control. It really goes to show the poor state of our educational system we learned about corona viruses in the 8th grade they are basically microscopic germs but I guess when you can barely read and count and still graduate highschool today what should we expect maybe we should focus on education because if Trump can do this because of your sheer ignorance than there's a bigger problem ahead.ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

@butlizzie @goldengateblond I had one person tell me that the virus was released to the public in an elaborate plot by Bill Gates to take down Trump because impeachment didnâ€™t work. Pointed to the fact that bottles of Lysol have â€œeffective on Coronavirusâ€ printed on the label as proof of said plot. ðŸ˜³
Every day when Carmelita finishes her shift in the strawberry fields of Californiaâ€™s central coast, she sprays herself down with Lysol, takes off the handkerchief she uses to protect her face, and tucks it in a plastic bag before getting in her car. Sheâ€™s the sole provider for her two young sons and canâ€™t afford to miss a day on the job. But these days, with the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the country, thatâ€™s getting much tougher. Carmelita carefully follows the safety precautions recommended by health experts, but thatâ€™s especially difficult in the fields. The farm where she works in Oxnard isnâ€™t enforcing safety protocols, the 44-year-old farmworker told Grist. (Carmelita requested that her last name be withheld because of fear of reprisals from her employer.) To make matters worse, her coworkers dismiss her repeated pleas that they maintain the expert-recommended six-foot distance from her. They laugh and tease her: â€œNothingâ€™s going to happen.â€ They tell her that, if she doesnâ€™t want to work, she should just go home. Carmelita, whose sons are 7 and 13, doesnâ€™t have that luxury. Every afternoon when she picks up her youngest from the babysitterâ€™s house, the first thing he does is run into her arms for a hug. The last thing Carmelita wants to do is infect him with the virus, but every day she runs that risk just to put food on the table for her sons â€” and the rest of California. â€œYouâ€™re trying not to get exposed, but unfortunately we donâ€™t have the ability to stop working,â€ Carmelita said in Spanish. â€œThe state calls us essential workers, but theyâ€™re not demonstrating our value. Weâ€™re putting ourselves at risk to feed the country.â€ As strawberry-picking season kicks into high gear in April and May, farmworker advocates fear that a lack of worker safety protections, combined with a lack of access to health care and crowded living conditions, could lead to a major COVID-19 outbreak in farmworker communities across California. As other crops are harvested throughout the spring, much of the rest of the country faces a similar risk. For a working population particularly vulnerable due to economic insecurity, exposure to pesticides, higher incidence rates of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, COVID-19 could be devastating.
@SolitaryServant @mikewCromwell People can go back to work w masks, soap/water/lysol to kill coronavirus. Self-distance. Hygiene. The lockdowns bc China is a filthy cesspool- and Italy exaggerated their death certificates is utterly ridiculous! Society cannot stop for every virus! Dr Fascist is paid globalist!
Lorrie Carpenter-Seabury The virus is not what the media is telling us. They plan it. Spread the Virus to make people PANIC. . It's a drill the Globalists wants NWO. We don't need hands sanitizer Lysol or toilet paper we need common sense. Why the major City in China is not affected? Like Beijing the capital and Shanghai because all the officials are living in there. Did you ever think about it?.

'If I could only Lysol my husband too': Sex in the age of coronavirus https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2020/04/04/sex-time-coronavirus/5083461002/
In the winter of 2002?2003, the deadly SARS coronavirus exploded out of China?s ?wet-blood? wildlife markets. SARS infected over 8,000 people worldwide and killed almost 800. Yet post-crisis, China laxly enforced bans on the offending markets, only to permit them to flourish soon thereafter. Today?s COVID-19 is the deadly and avoidable legacy of China?s recklessness. U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo has proclaimed that COVID-19 stems from just such Chinese ?wet-blood? markets. While Beijing has praised them as protein sources, their unsanitary practices have long been identified as ?perfect viral melting pots? for zoonotic diseases ? diseases that jump from animals to man. In COVID-19?s wake, China shut down cities and shuttered the offending Wuhan markets ? for now. Today the world strains to curtail COVID-19, mourn losses, and salvage livelihoods. Tomorrow it must prevent a like recurrence and account for damage done. Tomorrow?s tasks regrettably require forthrightly identifying and addressing Beijing?s wrongful, unnecessary, and repeated misdeeds. As many, including Dr. Bill Karesh of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, have shown, readily affordable measures, including refrigeration and culturally sensitive regulation, could replace China?s lax and dangerous wet-market practices. Yet Beijing persisted, even after SARS illustrated the international risks. That disturbing record proved a breeding ground for COVID-19 and may recur. Despite a vast treasury and a world-leading economy, the Chinese Communist leadership has neglected necessary reforms, spending lavishly instead to further hegemonic ambitions in Asia and beyond, as well as its hold on China. To expand her geo-political reach, China?s Belt and Road Initiative throws money at infrastructure projects from South Asia to the North Atlantic and from the South China Sea to Palau. National Bureau of Asian Research currently estimates BRI to cost around $1-1.3 trillion (USD). Over the past decades, China?s defense spending increased on average roughly 10 percent per year, a rate vastly exceeding any competitor. For a pittance of such expenditures, China could have avoided today?s pandemic and helped prevent future ones. Internally, the CCP has spent millions viciously repressing multi-child families, Internet use, Muslim Uighurs, Hong Kong democrats, and the Dalai Lama?s Tibet, to name a few. Food stalls would be child play. Who suffers from CCP leaders prioritizing international hegemony and party supremacy? The world. Sadly, after COVID-19 began to spread, China exacerbated its wrongful conduct: first covering it up; then hindering others? abilities to understand, halt, and mitigate the disease; and finally blaming its victims. In a recent interview, National Security adviser Robert O?Brien suggested that China?s cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak delayed the global response by two months. Chinese authorities, he noted, actively suppressed doctors? warnings. Once word got out, China then barred health experts from China, where they had hoped to study the disease and its spread. These lost months were costly. All the while, unwitting travelers spread the virus. Lost weeks delayed gathering medical supplies, readying facilities, and developing countermeasures. Having unnecessarily caused and exacerbated a worldwide pandemic, untouchable Chinese officials added their next outrage ? blaming America. Beijing shamelessly poses as both victim and savior, seeking disproportionate praise for sharing genome information, casualty data, and, relative to the harm, limited supplies. In any just and lawful setting, actors who recklessly pursue hazardous activities would be held accountable for foreseeable harm caused to others. It would not matter if the wrongdoers did not intend such harm; it would be enough that they knowingly persisted. Exacerbating harm by concealing it and retarding mitigation only increases such liability. Prevention and simple justice require that Beijing accept consequences facing any other wrongdoer ? including an end to dangerous practices and extending at least partial compensation to those so grievously harmed outside China. International diplomacy, legislation, executive action or legal proceedings here and abroad should seek to ensure Beijing acts responsibly. Yes, China, too, has suffered from its irresponsible practices. Many Chinese have tragically died, and Beijing?s guided economy has stumbled from Beijing?s misguided choices. However, the free world groans under horrendous losses of Beijing?s making. The unnecessary deaths will be staggering and financial losses crippling. According to assessments by the UN and others, this outbreak could cost the world between $1 to $2.7 trillion. As of mid-March, the U.S. stock market has dropped almost 30 percent from its mid-February high, wiping out nearly $3.7 trillion from the U.S. market alone. As families cower amid Lysol wipes, businesses reel from disrupted supply chains and operations. Recession looms, forcing states worldwide to introduce stimulus packages, with the U.S. debating a $1 trillion plan. Over the years, the self-appointed rulers of China have escaped not just domestic, but international liability for their wrongdoing. Over the years, their thefts of intellectual property, wrongful trade practices, ruthless domestic oppression, support of rogue regimes, proliferation of nuclear technology, and unlawful conduct in the South China Sea have been excused or effectively ignored. Certainly, China has never suffered setbacks commensurate with what it sought to gain. Why do Chinese leaders think they can get away with such wrongs? As President Trump warned Americans years ago, because they have. He added, shame on us for letting them do so. To his enormous credit, President Trump has said, ?Enough.? His administration has made great strides reversing the world?s complacency toward Beijing?s misdeeds. As the president and leaders like Senators Cotton and Rubio turn to bolstering U.S. defenses and preventing future devastation, American and world leaders alike should find ways to ensure that this time, China does more than temporarily close a market. Otherwise, the next ?wet-blood? pandemic awaits. https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/...table/#slide-1 Obviously with this being an American article, the Americans are going to have their own agenda.
Need help getting this message to the right people. Here in Queens, NY and in Manhattan, FRONTLINERS AND PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GO WORK AT CRITICAL STORES (LIKE PHARMACIES, SUPERMARKETS, ETC,) AND THOSE WHO NEED TO GO OUT SHOPPING... CANNOT FIND N95 MASKS, LYSOL, PURELL OR ALTERNATIVES. This is putting them, their families and everyone they come in contact with in danger and helping spread the the virus. Especially in our Hotspot. MEMO: NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM SAY, WE ARE NOT GETTING THESE SUPPLIES, I ALSO HEAR FROM FRONTLINERS THAT THEY ALSO ARE NOT GETTING THESE SUPPLIES, REGARDLESS. DOCTORS AND CLINICS ARE NOT OFFERING CORONA VIRUS TESTING, NOR ARE PRESCRIBING THE MALARIA DRUG COMBO TO THOSE WHO HAVE CLEAR SYMPTOMS AND COME INTO THE ER. VERBATIM. ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CRITICAL GET ADMITTED TO HOSPITALS AND GET TESTED. THE DOCTORS STILL SAY "THE DRUG COMBO IS NOT PROVEN TO WORK" AND THEY THEREFORE "DONT PRESCRIBE IT". EVEN IF YOU ARE AN ADMITTED PATIENT. This is why people are dropping like flies in the NYC area. I legally recorded calls with doctors, clinics and ER staff. This is fact! People need immediate supplies to stop this ever growing spread. They only consider prescribing it when it's TOO LATE and out of panic when they speculate the patient is likely to die within hours. At that point their organs are destroyed and there is no possibility of recovery! WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THESE STUBBORN RETARDED DOCTORS TO ADMINISTER/PRESCRIBE THIS DRUG COMBO AND TEST PEOPLE, SO THAT THEY KNOW, DON'T GO OUT INFECTING OTHERS AND GET TREATED. These doctors are playing God and causing people to die by not providing these tests or treatments. There are too many chefs in the kitchen! And many are apparantly God Complex Narcasists with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. ON A SIDE NOTE: STORES ARE NOT GETTING THESE SUPPLIES AND AMAZON IS NOT SELLING NEEDED SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO DONT WORK IN HOSPITALS OR DOCTORS OFFICES... This is causing the virus to spread and replicate. We need to stop its spread, not just at hospitals. Hospital staff are careful and have better access to supplies and protection; but the public are not that conscious/carefull and don't have any access. They need it most! WE ALL NEED ACCESS TO THESE SUPPLIES ESPECIALLY IN HOT SPOTS. PLEASE HELP RECTIFY THIS IMMEDIATELY!
Never in my life did I think.... Someone knocked on my door. I opened the door and nobody was there. There was a single wrapped roll of TP on the doormat from a local church as a donation with "You've been TP'ed" on it. I looked around and saw nobody....paused, and then shut the door. I grabbed a Lysol wipe and went back out, wiped the door and then proceeded to pick up the TP roll carefully with the wipe, took it inside to the kitchen. I proceeded to wash my right hand while holding the TP in my left hand. The phone rings...but I'm not willing to lose the TP, so I continue. I take off the wrapper with my dirty hand and carefully threw the wrapper in the trashcan without touching it. Then, I went back and washed both hands and the trash can lid...just in case. All for a single free roll...of TP.
Americans I have a question? If the government is saying to practice safe hygiene! Whereâ€™s the Lysol,Bleach,& All the other disinfectant for over a month none & I have family that lives in Alabama where thereâ€™s no cases itâ€™s like the government wontâ€™s us to catch Coronavirus?

I assumed (wrongly, apparently) that most people got groceries delivered. Now, the only one thatâ€™s available to me is Tesco, because Iâ€™ve used there delivery previously - none of them are taking new customers. Tesco have no slots over the next three weeks. New slots are made available at midnight, for 21 days ahead - you cannot get onto Tescos site at midnight, by the time you do, there are no slots available. So, no supermarket delivery. I really would rather not visit a supermarket - some things I can get delivered from specialist suppliers, and thereâ€™s a local greengrocer who will deliver. So it is an opportunity for local producers to sell meat, eggs, veg etc. Thanks for the warning - I just signed up with Instacart in case they cut of new members! I also signed up with Safeway, so I at least have an account. Referencing my earlier post where I said Instacart have a new deal with Costco, I tried to see if I could order TP or Lysol spray through Instacart from Costco; no availability. Not sure if that's simply because they are now down to zero inventory, or if the products themselves are 'not eligible'. I'll try again later. I then moved on to 'Sprouts' via Instacart; Sprouts is a very nice local grocery chain (sort of a cheapo Whole Foods). Looks like I can get a delivery window next wednesday (so 5 days from now). I can't seem to find enough items to make up an order, though - I would never buy fresh tomatoes or a 'salad mix' via a delivery service, because I don't know how careful the delivery people are with perishables (it's already hitting 80F every day (27F) and I always head straight home once I buy perishables). So let me see if I can make up a decent order ...
If we catch this virus, we will know its from going to the grocery store. It's impossible to get an order date, well I can get one in 3 weeks, but if I use our grocery money now for an order in 2 weeks, we can't get anything to get us through until that order in 3 weeks, online ordering for groceries has proven non-viable unless you can wait 2 weeks. I knew back in February that this would be an issue, getting food without exposing yourself to others is near impossible.

Big board outside announcing 'no stock' for all the things I cared about. So then on to Costco. Got there at 9, for a 10am opening. Long, long organized line of people, using shopping carts as a natural distance tool (set up ahead of time by the workers, so you just slotted yourself in behind the first empty cart - very organized). Lucked out and stood "next to" a rather intelligent lady who helped me pass the hour with conversation ( a redneck was behind me, talking about communism and socialism ... was not in the mood for THAT conversation!). Two real cops on duty also, though no sign of any trouble. Helicopter flying overhead ... I think this was a newsworthy event! Doors opened; rolled in very calmly, and there was the longest line of Charmin TP packages I have EVER seen. I think they said they got 48 pallets or something. Max 1 per, with 1=48 rolls. Also paper towels and ... my delight - Lysol spray! And Kleenex! Also picked up a 'flat' of apples, and a few other miscellaneous items. Very well stocked in most regards - all manner of fresh meats, frozen fish, etc. FORGOT to look for frozen veg . No wait at the checkout. New perspex barriers installed to protect the checkout workers. Parking lot 75% full on departure circa 10:30am. Costco gas station had zero line - emptiest I've ever seen it. I think our gas is now $1.95 / gallon or something ridiculous. Costco here are opening an hour early for those 60+ but only on Tue/Wed/Thu. But today (Fri), they had a new program (apparently just started today) - they were opening an hour early for INSTACART (personal shopping service). So while waiting in line, I was able to see instacart shoppers already filling their cars with booty. I will deffo look into that. Drove to another Costco for grins, they had a long line even at 10 so didn't bother even trying. Based on the amount of stuff I saw in the 'rest of the store' there's no need to go early and deal with crowds if all you need are food and such. Also, a couple of days ago, saw this on the road - a branded Safeway / Albertsons delivery truck, so it would seem Safeway are not outsourcing delivery to 3rd parties.

Well thank the Lord. The Walmart in Pahrump Nevada 89048 pisses me off to no end. You got a greeter that won't get out of the damn way. Another guy checking receipts on the way out neither one are over 6 feet away I had to ask him to get out of the damn way so I could get into the damn store and he just stood there smiling through his tooth like I he didn't know what I was talking about. Told management. And still they can't put the wet wipes and hand sanitizer out front when it runs out or paper towels and a spray bottle. They started cleaning the carts when they're brought in but when I grabbed a loose cart away from the others that looked like someone just left it when they exited store. There was only spray bottles and no paper towels and of course he was nowhere to be found so I started cleaning it myself then he has the nerve to come back from break or wherever he was and tell me that all of these were cleaned already and had no idea where I got my cart from I could have got it from outside for all he knew and I could have got Corona virus. So no offense but when I'm talking about my life I'm not going to take your word for it especially since you just returned from someplace and I grabbed this cart from one foot away from where I'm standing and ten feet away from three rows of carts that were connected together. So I smiled and I said let's just be sure and I cleaned it myself. Come on guys when I tried leaving the store you're 2 sliding doors one on the left side and 1 on the right side I came out the left side and he's right in middle of both doors outside so if I walk by him I would be about three feet away so I said hey there Old Timer. And he looked at me I said you think you might want to back up so I can get out of the store? And a perfect way to end the day at Walmart, another Blank Stare and completely oblivious to what I'm talkin about so I said again 6ft bro. Nobody can get buy you from either door if you're standing between both of them when they come out. Come on man you know what six feet is. Same with walking in the store you got one guy standing in the middle of the hall with Subway on your left and if you take a right you can go down to customer service but he's right in the middle there with three feet on both sides of him. I stopped and I looked at him and I'm like you want to step back so I can get into the damn store? Of course he just had a blank stare on his face and then a smile. fantastic had to talk to management again. Three of the four times I go there they're out of everything up front to clean your carts or your hands. I asked him hey can we get some new stuff here? and seemed like they wanted to make an excuse about it I said It was no big deal it's just you know Coronavirus. I'm only a caregiver that has two seniors in their mid-70s at home that happen to be my parents that ignorant people like you AR trying to kill right in front of my face with a stupid smile on your face and no idea what you're doing. so I should have grabbed the managers happy ass to show him how he could keep this going on when it's completely apparent there's no care for our loved ones at home you people are trying to kill us. Thank you for finally taking shitt seriously. You're right the Isles were too small to go down so I just kept my head turned to the other way and every time I'm in the produce with no one around me I start bagging vegetables and before the bag is full three people came up and barely brushed my shoulder that didn't have any patients or respect for me to finish what I was doing first. I cussed under my breath each and every time . I go to that store about 2 times a week and on that last visit it must have been ten times could have got infected and had to cuss under my breath . I was completely disgusted and worn out by the time I get home trying to disinfect my groceries with Lysol and washing my hands hoping I got everything just frustrated and completely stressed out because people are stupid and inconsiderate. Sorry for going on like that but it is what it is I needed to vent. 5 people at a time in the store sounds good to me. I have patient and little bit of self-restraint. Sounds like heaven to me.

You need to set limits on certain essential items. Why can't all of us find bleach, lysol, hand sanitizer when we need it. Stop the hoarder and price gougers!!

#DearLysol we will remember these times that when we needed you the most, you werenâ€™t there for us. #OutOfStock #Lysol #Covid19
just a thought:they tell us to use lysol at our homes to control coronavirus.so why not send up crop dusters and soak the earth with lysol.or use misquoto trucks through neighborhoods to fill the air with lysol mist.since lysol is already earth friendly.
RT @bruce_fritts: So @TuckerCarlson had an infectious disease doc on last nite sayin the #COVID19 virus attaches itself especially to the membranes or speciality cells at the entrance to the nose. I'm thinkin I'll just dab a little lysol or something similar to the inside of my nose while i'm out?
@kylegriffin1 Whose knows why that idiot does anything. Just let November get here soon. I do not care if coronavirus is still here in November I am going to go to the polls with my homemade mask, gloves, lysol wipes and my own pen to vote that asshole out of office.
#CoronaVirus advice cont.: Have a plan for decontamination before you leave the house. Have a few paper towels, spayed with disinfectant (or use Lysol wipes) and placed in areas ahead of time. Along with PPE, I take a paper towel, soaked in Lysol, into the store with me.
Just give it a light spray with Lysol or any type of aerosol disinfectant.
Has Lysol provided any kind of update on production of products? Been weeks since Iâ€™ve even anything like wipes or spray.
CDC has informed and knows that the virus does not last very long on surfaces. You can just not touch it and wash your hands after setting it down for a few hours to a full day until the virus dries up and dies. Wipe the cover well with a disinfectant wipe (lysol or clorox wipe) and you can use a clorox or lysol or any disinfectant spray to fan through the pages and spray them lighty with a disinfectant spray. Be careful with bleach based sprays, they could damage the book by removing the ink.Â Or you can just throw it out and get a new one. If you choose to dispose of it be sure to seal it in it's own plastic air-tight bag to lock any contaminents on it in so it doesn't have the possability of infecting anyone.
@kayemclaren @twirtz12473 @maladamus Dude, the Lysol label literally says it kills Coronavirus
@Eric Schmuecker B.t.w. what do you eat from 3m or lysol? They may feed you but not me.
I see lots of people saying that if you can't use bleach/Lysol to clean surfaces, soap will work in a pinch. Actually, soap works great. Here's why/how: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21185262/how-soap-kills-the-coronavirus
Dear @Walmart @DollarGeneral @Lysol how can we stay clean and sanitized when we can't find any products and the workers withhold products from us???? This is stupid smh #coronavirus #makeitavailable

Yea spray LYSOL on the bags anb your food you bought then throw it away lol
That's not even as bad as it gets. 2 cans of Lysol went for 4,000 dollars on an ebay auction. Yes, thousand.
@mitchellvii ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ASK ? Did the last few rounds of Flu Shots have Coronavirus in its Mix? Are they the ones who are dying ? Guess who got it first ? You got it the Seniors ! Letâ€™s find out shall we ? ASK ? Also , why does Lysol have on the Label ? Kills Coronavirus !
Courtesy? What's that? Manners? That's for those other people. At first everybody across the planet were scared. But as time passes and folks don't see people melting just flopping over they become complacent. Then the gubment says "stay home", the same gubment that shut down their livlihood, and now promises to mail out a $1200 stipend (one of these days)Â…Â… There is an entire society going back to when Vietnam live was on the 6:30 news each evening that have never faced true adversity. 911 was probably the closest to that and by sundown we all knew our country was not being invaded by those scarey monsters from that country over there. Now this thing we are being told is going to keep us in peril for monthsÂ…Â… We are in week, what? 3, 4? since the gubment pulled the plug and folks are looking around going "I don't know anybody sick".Â…Â…yeah the news boasts the death clock every afternoon. Governors are holding press conferences scolding kids for being kids, but the common person in Idaho, in New Mexico or Arizona have been couped up for weeks now. And unless they are geeking out on numbers, locations, what exactly is this whole covid thing and all that, they are starting to scoff at the notion that it's even going to affect them at all. That's the folks who all self quarentined, social distance or just comply with CDC reccomendations. Some will never give up their ways. Some don't care about anybody but themselves. Screw covid I want what I want and I want it right now. We see a lot of that in our community that is now about 50/50 masked, unmasked people. I trained a youngster all winter and he went elsewhere. Good guy, means well. But the other day he was tasked to help me and I had to keep reminding him about my 3 foot circle is now 6 feet. Am I scared if gets 3 feet away that covid will get me? No. I'm more scared of some bored, unemployed person with a camera will snap a photo of us 4 feet apart and send it to the 6 o'clock news, then my boss sees it on tv and fires my happy arse. We have one lady who enters the building each afternoon spraying the air with lavender Lysol. One day my young trainee asked her why she did that. "Because people are stupid, and I have a sick grandma at home" she says. I quipped "nuff said". Last edited by bykfixer; Today at 06:48 AM. John 3:16

i just used a #lysol wipe to wipe down a bottle of lysol disinfectant spray because it might have gotten contaminated. things have gone too far. #covid19
Is coronavirus part of the 99.9% of germs Lysol kills or the 0.1% it doesnâ€™t?
@brithume 2018-19 flu season: 80K died, 900K hospitalized but the country kept moving. No one said to wash our hands, stay 6 ft apart, stay home. There wasnâ€™t a shortage of TP, Lysol, or bread. Best of all no one was panicking. The response to COVID19 is the real disaster!
Well that was scary. I got a package today of stuff I ordered from @amazon and I realized I had no idea who'd packed the box or handled it. So I'm frantically spraying the box, contents, & my doorknobs with Lysol. Then sprinted to wash my hands while singing. #fucorona #COVID19
Corona virus been out a long time read on the back of your can of Lysol,take heed God isn't playing Repent for The Kingdom of God is at Hand
Two weeks ago a lady made a huge Facebook post about how corona is a prolifically hoax to control us and to keep going about your lives and donâ€™t worry about the Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer etc... she is now dead from the corona virus. Damn. Karma comes at ya fast huh?
I run a small residential cleaning company and 75% of my clients have cancelled due to their home, kids are home, canâ€™t afford it now or scared to have anyone in. All understandable But hurts when thatâ€™s how I pay my bills also! I know Iâ€™m not in this alone and itâ€™s all over the city with people struggling but today I struggle as even husband was let go yesterday so now Iâ€™m officially panicked about how tomorrow will look. Itâ€™s not short term but long term thatâ€™s terrifying. Thanks to let me rant! Dear Valued Client, Hi there, I hope this finds you and yours well. During this Coronavirus crisis we want our clients to know that we will continue business as usual as long as we are allowed to. We will certainly abide by whatever rules and guidelines that are set by Alberta Health authorities. We are taking necessary precautions to protect you and ourselves. Myself and staff have gloves, and Lysol and hand sanitizer available to use each and every home. We will make a point to be extra vigilant on wiping all door handles and high touch surfaces. I have made it clear no one is to come to work sick. I ask that if you or someone in your household is sick let us know and so we can reschedule. This virus is effecting us all in one way or another and I pray this over soon. If you have any questions or concerns please let me know and letâ€™s chat. Thank you for your continued business as always. Kerri Workman. 403-969-2825 Turbo cleaning.

Well, you get and "F"-! Today!! With the COVID-19 pandemic... Wells Fargo location in Las Vegas at Jones Blvd/ W Cheyenne Ave were doing well at not allowing mire than 5 people in the lobby with appointments. However, NO ONE was sanitizng the windows after customers left!! No where did I see a sanitizer dispenser like they claim!! Maybe this bunch is LAZY!!?? Luckily I had Lysol wipes in my purse to wipe down area for my 94 yr old mother to do her banking transactions! She demands to be at the bank and I feel Wells Fargo failed to protect ita customers. When I asked one of the 5 folks walking around in a 'Volunteer Tshirt'... all he could say to me was " someone comes in to clean the bank early in the morning before the open '. WHAT?!?! NO SANITIZING between customers!!!! Hello!!! This is serious and bad business. Maybe if you get shut down by the Govenor you will be more cautious. I'm disgusted. 25 year + loyal customer... SAD.

RT @KathleenStutz3: @themcfiles44 ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸Look at the label of your old Lysol product . Yep ! Kills Coronavirus .
Welcome to SaturYourDay. Today, I have decided to write about my personal experience with the coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a healthcare worker and tips that you can use to help you through this crisis. As many of you know from reading my blog, I have worked as a Psychiatric Screener for the past 15 years in the healthcare industry. If you donâ€™t know what a Psychiatric Screener allow me to explain. A Psychiatric Screener is licensed in the state of New Jersey to determine if individuals are a danger to themselves or others, or if persons have thoughts of wanting to harm themselves or someone else. I evaluate adults over the age of 18 in their homes, at local hospitals, police stations, and other secure locations throughout the community. Anytime I go out into the community, I go with a police officer who assists in making sure the scene is safe and that the patient is transported to the nearest emergency room. However, since the outbreak of the coronavirus our unit isnâ€™t conducting much mobile outreach into the community unless it is absolutely necessary. As a screener, I have a decent rapport and good relationship with the local law enforcement officials throughout the county. I currently work and live in Essex County, NJ, which is the second New Jersey county most affected by the Coronavirus. Our department is located inside the emergency room and even though we have a separate department from the medical side of the emergency room, we still have to walk through the main emergency room to get into the crisis unit. I remembered towards the end of February, there were maybe one or two patients that possibly had the coronavirus and now at the end of March, there are countless patients coming into the hospital believing that they have Covid-19. Very recently on my social media channels, I have started documenting my experience dealing with COVID-19. I am considered to be essential personnel, so I am required to work. I am doing everything humanly possible to protect myself from contracting Covid 19 including praying, meditating, wearing the Protective Clothing when going outside of my house especially when I go into work, cooking all of my food, taking my vitamins daily, constantly watching my hands, and even obeying the stay at home order when I am not scheduled to work. On the flip side, others are not. I live by myself in my own apartment, however, the building I live in has other tenants. I am telling you, I am constantly hearing my neighbors go in and out when I am home during the day and when I come home from work at night. I get off from work at midnight and live very close to my job, so it doesnâ€™t take me very long to get home. Almost every night I hear my neighbors going in and out of their apartments well after 1:00 am. Governor Phil Murphy issued mandatory stay at home orders for all NJ residents on Saturday, March 21. There are still people disobeying the law by doing whatever they want to do which is causing the rapid spread of COVID-19 in our community. What others donâ€™t take seriously, can affect the wellbeing of the others who are trying to protect themselves. I have learned over the years that I canâ€™t control other peopleâ€™s behaviors, but just my own. I have to decided to provide you with quick tips to help you during this time. Tip 1: Burning White Sage. White sage is a natural herb that you can purchase from Whole Foods or online from Walmart or Target. I suggest burning sage regularly because Lysol spray is basically sold out everywhere plus Lysol is a chemical, which is not healthy to be spraying daily into the air. Sage kills 94% of the airborne pathogens can last up to 24 hours. White Sage does have a strong odor, which smells similar to weed. Sage smells is often mistaken for weed so when you burn it just let your family know what it is before you burn it. Tip 2: Taking Vitamins As I mentioned earlier, you have to make sure you take more than just a multi-vitamin daily, especially during these challenging times. Add to your vitamin regimen, a vitamin C, D3, Iron (especially from women who suffer from being anemic), and black seed oil. The pill of the black seed oil is fine to take, but I take the liquid, which tastes horrible, but gets into my system much quicker. These vitamins will help build up your immune system to help you fight off any viruses that you may come into contact with. Tip 3: Clothing I know that the weather is starting change, but the coronavirus is still in the air even though you canâ€™t see or smell it. You have to be aware of it no matter how many sunny and beautiful days that may come our way. You have to cover your hair because the virus in the air. In addition, make sure you are wearing long sleeves and pants when you go outside even when it is warm outside. It more than likely will be uncomfortable, but you are doing this to protect yourself. However, if you donâ€™t wear the long sleeves and pants outdoors, make sure the first thing you do when you come back into the house is to take a shower and throw your clothes into a plastic bag (if you donâ€™t have washing machine). When I go into work, I wear two layers of clothing due to working in the emergency room and coming into contact with so many sick people. I treat every person that comes to the ED, as if they have Coronavirus because I donâ€™t know who does or doesnâ€™t have it. Tip 4: Limited Your Intake of Social Media/The News I believe to help with stress, depression, and anxiety you will have to limit your intake of social media/news about the Coronavirus. Since most of us at home and some of us are working from home as well, use the time to get things done around the house whether that is organizing, spring cleaning, etc. You can spend your time and energy focusing on things that will keep your mind on a positive and constructive activities to complete. Tip 5: Prayer/Meditation One of the most important things that has helped me through my life is prayer and meditation. Prayer helps me stay to God-centered throughout my day. As a prayer warrior, I am constantly praying for people throughout my day as so many people are suffering. I am very thankful that God has given to me this gift to pray as feel like I am not just helping myself, but countless of other people that God has placed into my spirit to pray for. I am very thankful to God for blessing me with food on the table, clothes on my back, and a roof over my head. I believe when you are thankful for just the smallest things in life that shows God how truly grateful you are towards Him. In addition, meditation is something that I practice daily as I play my singing bowls, which are helping lift my energy and the energy of those around me. It very important for me to meditate with my singing bowls at least once a day as it helps for me to stay positive and focused. I pray that my personal experience that I have shared will help you to cope with the COVID-19 better. Please feel to share your comments and suggestions, I would love to hear from you. Until then, I am looking forward to sharing my next blog post on Saturday, May 2 at 11am ET. In the meantime make sure you connect with us on the social media links, remembered to be safe, stay positive, and if God is for you, who can be against you? I love you, and God Bless. https://www.instagram.com/saturyourday/ https://www.instagram.com/ayasharoberson/ https://www.facebook.com/ayasha.roberson https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayasha-roberson-1b20142b/
[QUOTE="VIXFIX, post: 1747669, member: 30313"] We have none at work. Just those flimsy ones. We have to wear them at all times for 5 shifts before getting new ones. [/QUOTE] So can you disinfect with Lysol or something and still wear the next day?
Seriously do you Sheeples still believe you're lying corporate government media CNN MSNBC ++++ you really aren't that stupid are you As we are on basic lockdown the death rate from this coronavirus which by the way had been around so long it's on Lysol cans is > 0.00000921 < an extremely low number 1.4 million died last year from heart disease let me be clear that's [ 3600 ] people a day die from heart disease in the United States! compared to coronavirus which in 2 + months has killed less --- than 10000 as we obediently accept were under a form of Martial law we have completely lost our Constitution and our minds and our moral compass we are now crashing our economy which in 9 to 18 months will send us into a depression unparalleled by the 1929 crash as you all keep on Believing the same media the told us the Jeffrey Epstein the Kingpin of massive crime in the government magically committed suicide in the most guarded jail in the country the fact that you people keep believing your corporate government media is a form of insanity oh this just in 4.4 million people +++ in California are claiming unemployment food shortages will increase that will turn into crisis and the coming months your economy is in meltdown but don't worry nothing to see here move along https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRKiI94Ghfc&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR0YxzJ2kgGOjQaXj9RS63Y9Q0WRTVrwgartqk7uTdqIm8ULdyRv1vtHZQs
Cov19 A way to keep your family safe The best way to keep your family safe is you your self to not get infected. In order to prevent infection, you need to understand how the virus makes contact. According to research, this happens 1 of 2 ways. The first form is Aerosol Transmission. "Aerosol transmission has been defined as person-to-person transmission of pathogens through the air by means of inhalation of infectious particles. Aerosols are emitted not only by aerosol-generating procedures, but may also be transmitted whenever an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or exhales." stated by https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741245_3 . This is the form of transmission the CDC is not emphasizing or explaining and why they state that it is "not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19." because a facemask alone will not help prevent the virus from entering through your eyes. The main problem is "Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat (these symptoms have been observed in only about 5% of patients). Sore throat, sneezing, and stuffy nose are most often signs of a cold". stated by https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-symptoms/ The second is Fomite transmission. "Fomite transmission occurs when viruses or bacteria that remain on surfaces cause infections. This is as opposed to diseases being transmitted from person to person, in the air, in infected water, or in another manner", stated by www.verywellhealth.com Examples of fomites include contaminated vehicles, shovels, clothing, bowls/buckets, brushes, ex. To prevent this form of infection the CDC advises *To avoid close contact with people who are sick. *Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. *Stay home when you are sick. *Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. *Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. So in order to protect my family and me, these are the steps I've been taking. I have a specific outfit I wear over my clothing. I keep my mask and glasses on at all times and avoid close contact with people when I go out. When I come home I decontaminate. 2 ways to kill the virus is Clorox and Dry heat. I remove my clothes and place them in the dryer for 15min. This is because the virus begins to die outside the body at temperatures of 30Â°C [86Â°F]. Heat at 56Â°C kills the SARS coronavirus. (The virus thrives in cool moisture, its the same reason the flu comes in the winter and leaves in the summer.) Then I begin spraying any times I have brought in from outside with watered-down Clorox. 0.1% sodium hypochlorite is enough to kill off the infection. Once satisficed I place them in a clean bag to take to the kitchen inside. I personally turned my laundry room into a makeshift decontamination station because this was the best approach to keep my family safe since no one is taking this plague seriously. The biggest problem we are having right now is not Covid 19, its the misinformation that keeps getting sent out by the media. Misinformation only brings fear, fear brings panic, and if not controlled will only cause chaos. I understand that we all have a life to maintain, and bills to pay and the pressure of a simple day sometimes does not let you do anything, but it is important that we understand, that the Corona Virus, named Covid -19 is something serious. Please understand, just because the virus started in China is not meant it will come from China. That is being ignorant. * The virus has been global since January due to the airlines not being shut down. Now you can see cases in the rest of the world where people haven't even visited China. The reason the reported cases are low right now is that they aren't testing people that haven't been to China. * The Virus does not discriminate, don't do it too... The information I propose is not to scare or incite panic, it is a piece of simple advice that China was a warning. From the beginning, they hid information to maintain control and it was impossible. And even now they are still misinforming people. Don't wait for the warning, it's here. When you go out please put on a mask, even if you feel well to stifle the virus. Don't let the hospitals get overcrowded. Some otherwise healthy people do seem to develop a severe form of pneumonia after being infected by the virus. Time from onset to the development of the severe disease is mild in most cases for approximately 2 weeks. Severe or critical issues appear approximately 3-6 weeks. Schools need to be shut down. Take your kids out of school, keep them home and teach them there, kids are the hardest to keep safe and even if their immune system gets through the infection others in your family may not. The only people that are not willing to help stop the spread are the ones that don't care about you or your family's wellbeing. Try to Self-isolate with your family. If you do need to go out, only deal with people and businesses who are willing to cooperate. Businesses need to shut down for a day to fully decontaminate and let no person or personnel in without a proper face mask. The government should be held liable and begin providing free N95 face masks to the public. Please help me spread the right information and share it.

Wear masks, is better than worst. For me its important for the spray propagation. Use a bowl with soap and water at the entrance of your houses or apartments, put your harms inside for 10 seconds and then go to wash in your bathroom. Wash grocerys that goes inside your home. Dont take any chances. Dont touch your face when you are out. Stay safe at home if you can. Change tour cloth when you get home. Wash doors . Use lysol spray for eveything has been touch
Scored a bottle of Lysol at the Walmarts today. Felt like I had won the lottery. #CoronaVirus #Rona
Itâ€™s also a great day because I finally found Lysol and toilet paper. ðŸŽ‰ #COVID19
Iâ€™m really trying to find the humor in all of this. We are going on our third week of jail/quarantine, and spring is dancing in with its happy face. Something blue and Little Dog pack helping with quarantine. Sort of. Photo by Holly Covey That happy face also has with it a lovely yellow pollen along with the lovely yellow daffodils and dandelions, making us all sneeze, our eyes water, and occasionally (gasp) cough. Well, as you can imagine, right now when someone coughs, itâ€™s like The Black Death is among us. All panicked hell breaks loose in the household. We frantically search for the people thermometer to see if there is a fever present. Well, if you are a horse person, you know the difference between the barn thermometer and the people thermometer. The problem is, when you canâ€™t find the barn one, you need one, you use the people one. Right? So if you canâ€™t find the people one â€¦ well, we ended up using the heat gun, that is used for welding and tendon hot spots â€¦ not sure that was a really good reading, though. All good so far. Just allergies. Being home is like a wonderful vacation. Sort of. The house is getting really clean a little cleaning, Iâ€™ve caught up on the laundry, the kitchen floor is really clean pretty good, and Iâ€™ve thought about polishing the silver. Major accomplishment: nobody has killed anyone yet, so itâ€™s all good. Although itâ€™s crossed my mind. And I do have lots of Lysol and bleach to clean up any bloodstains. Just sayinâ€™. Then you look out the door and because you arenâ€™t working, thereâ€™s not only a load of time to do all sorts of stuff around the house, there is also a project in the barn to start, and another project over there, and big plans for that paddock, and work to be done on the â€¦ and I say, well, this is getting complicated, I need to start a list. You do not want to see the list. Itâ€™s out of control. I canâ€™t remember the first thing and I canâ€™t remember the last thing, but in there somewhere I can remember two of the things on it: getting my hair trimmed, and fix the fence charger box. I started writing it in a notebook and one of the items â€” truth â€” is make list of things to do, use new notebook and date it. So â€¦ itâ€™s in a used notebook and I stopped dating it Wednesday. Or Thursday. Whatever day. Theyâ€™re all running together. Made the grievous error of posting a political thing on Facebook, took two days to get over that. Sticking now to funny horse/people memes. The latest thing was posting something in your camera roll in a certain color. Well, I paint a lot of jumps and I have jumps in every color in the rainbow in my camera roll, so next to the cute kids in the pumpkin patch Iâ€™ve got my orange jump; next to the beautiful blue sky at the beach, Iâ€™ve got my sun and moon jump fillers with the blue background; and underneath the nice red rose arrangement on someoneâ€™s dining table, I have my red and white striped planks. I think some of my Facebook friends have unfriended me. The horses love coronavirus. They are enjoying hanging out without much real work at this point although I am hacking a bit. I did drop their feed to avoid Severe Airs Above The Ground syndrome. Fortunately, spring is bringing grass, and that is occupying a lot of their outdoors time at the moment. Event Horse is having his time in the proximity of that green stuff limited a bit at this point. Event Horse took a bit of exception to that last change, and busted out of his stall, with a little help from another horse who is retired here and has nothing better to do than cause trouble. So in the middle of the night, they got into the shavings pile and pooped in it and spread it all around. They knocked over some stuff. But Event Horse proved he actually knows something very interesting â€” if not a bit spooky. I have a bag of horse treats, in a container, with the grooming equipment near the crossties. So the grooming tools were scattered, the bag was EMPTY. He ate ALL of them. Iâ€™m not sure he didnâ€™t share them with the retired horse who was also enjoying Freedom, but I know he knows where they are. Every last one of them. Not even the dust at the bottom of the bag was left. And the empty bag was dropped ON PURPOSE in front of a horse who was not loose, almost like a horsey â€œup yours.â€ So not only do I know he knows, Iâ€™m afraid of where this might lead. If he can do that, what else is he keeping tabs on and what more can he do when I am not there to shut the gate and lock it properly? So heâ€™s been doing more than just standing on the cross ties at grooming time. Speaking of grooming, the hair is on full spring shed-out mode. I found a curry comb with teeth left in it, and got to work shedding out Event Horse. I grabbed a broom and was sweeping the hair into a nice medium sized pile, when one of the Little Dogs sees the broom, which is a fun toy to him, and runs in for a grab. I was just about to get the pile nice and small â€” and the broom gets dragged gleefully down the aisle. The hair goes flying. All over. In my mouth. On the horse it just came off. In my socks and down my neck. And down other items of underwear which I am sure you can relate to. So fun. To pass the time, I am taking stock of my jumps and painting them. My little dog is helping. He digs holes while I paint. Keeps him busy and I donâ€™t have to drag him out of the neighborâ€™s garage when he chases their cat down the driveway. So, Iâ€™m painting away, and moving down the rail striping as I go. Heâ€™s digging away. You know where this is going. Yeah, I stepped slowly, carefully, deliberately, concentrating on getting the stripe just right â€¦ and â€¦ fell. The paint goes down. I go down. In that order so the paint got on me and all over a freshly painted rail, and a little tiny bit on the digger. Lots of swearing. No more digging allowed! This was disappointing to the Little Dog, who then was forced to chew up a good pair of barn boots while in Time-Out. So, realizing the outdoors was not really a fine place to be getting The List checked off today, I went back inside and decided to bake something. Except there are no ingredients in the cabinet. Somehow, essentials needed for survival are not available at the local grocery store right now. So that goal was dashed. I donâ€™t think olive oil and pepper will work for oatmeal cookies. The last refuge of scoundrels is now the internet, so I got on the computer and tried to start an argument and even that failed. At this point, the television is the last thing left of civilization, but in my household, Mr. Eventer holds the coveted remote, and without control of that precious weapon, Iâ€™m dead in the water. Canâ€™t even see that Tiger thingie. (Do I need to?) So here I am trying to make the most of this and make myself laugh. I signed up for a daily joke on my phone. â€œDue to the Covid-19 restriction, we are no longer sending the Daily Jokeâ€ was the message I got this morning. I canâ€™t believe it. There just isnâ€™t anything funny about it, I guess. But the worst of all was the toilet paper problem. I was forced, almost by gunpoint, to the horse trailer tack room, to obtain a last final stash of secret toilet paper. This made me cry. It really is the end of the season when you take the toilet paper out of the horse trailer, isnâ€™t it?
Different strain of coronavirus than that on Lysol cans
Coronavirus is listed on the back of Lysol cans
RT @TimothyBair: @kristenluvslife @justjessie226 Read the Lysol label...guess what it kills "Human Coronavirus"ðŸ˜‚
Too late! We gon' Lysol the pantry tho! #Not ðŸ™„ RT @tttliveonline: Supermarket and market goods should be thoroughly cleaned before storing in your home. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Roshan Parasram gives us some tips on sanitisation. #COVID19
[QUOTE="OrangeCrush392, post: 1747683, member: 22983"] So can you disinfect with Lysol or something and still wear the next day? [/QUOTE] Nope. Any liquid disintegrates them pretty quick. We have to go to the keeper of the masks with the old one to get a new one if it's before the 5 shift mark. We aren't allowed to wear any homemade ones either. Not to mention we can't wear gowns with any new admits from hospitals if they are asymptomatic...it could take 5 days for symptoms to develop per CDC. So...is it potentially on my clothes or glasses or shoes? Still having to use my own gait belt patient to patient. There are so many things wrong with procedures right now versus what it should be. I tried telling the company suggestions beginning of March to no avail. Already told the hubby my wishes...you never know.
Spray your masks with Lysol and put vapour rub inside nostrils?
People look at me Crazy when I Disinfect the gas pump with Lysol or wipes or even wear Disposable Gloves!!!
YaBoyBryan my point exactly so whatever they injecting people with is the real cause of death ðŸ’€ and not no coronavirus that they had in a movie 3 years ago, on back of Lysol cans, n they inject cows ðŸ„ with it n how long both those been around!! Donâ€™t trust mainstream media or this government
I only go out when I absolutely have to. With 4 children at home, we have been running out of food here and there. I have only one N95 mask. I use a nylon/cotton cover over it. When I go to the store I use it. When I get home, I spray it with Lysol disinfectant spray and let it air dry. Is this safe for me to do? Or should I be throwing it away each time? Again, I only have one, so thatâ€™s why I spray it with the spray.
Gargle these ingredients together and defy the mass media fuckery about the facemasks! Hot Water Baking Soda Squeezed Lemon Vinegar Repeat twice per day with a strict immuno boosting diet! Together these ingredients empower the Sodium Bicarbonate in Baking Soda which is and has been the #1 killer of the Multiple Viruses for 100+ years! This is not new people wake up! Lysol like other products have had Corona Virus on the back if their labels since inception, long before most people even knew what it was!
A cashier at Walmart used sanitizer after every transaction and said her hands stung from how dry her hands become from sanitizing so much. Why sanitize after every interaction with money or person to just do it again 10 seconds later. This is how paranoid people are becoming. Also If they knew and read the Clorox wipes label and the Lysol label it says you have to leave product on surface for ten minutes undisturbed for product to work, they would probably pass out from fear and paranoia. And this being a â€œnewâ€ â€œnovelâ€ coronavirus why would they recommend using sanitizer and Clorox wipes there is no research or proof this kills the â€œnewâ€ coronavirus. But it does say it kills human coronavirus that has been around for centuries there has even been a pandemic before.
I'm 52, in good health with no pre-existing conditions. Living in Montreal (Canada's COVID hotspot with 1/4 of the country's cases), so I don't feel like leaving the house. Haven't stepped out in 10 days and it's getting boring but I count my blessings. I do my groceries every two weeks. Have food, antibacterial gel, and toilet paper to get past the end of days (*), but running out of Lysol wipes. (If you're wiping your behind with Lysol, let's make a deal.) On the bright side, it looks like my job is safe (at least for the foreseeable future) and, more importantly, no one in my family has symptoms. Two of them were living in NY but returned to Canada mid-March. Stay safe, everyone. Don't do anything adventurous like opening the front door. (*) I'm not a covidiot. I had bought a couple huge packages of rolls that were on sale at Walmart just a week before everything exploded.
Every day when Carmelita finishes her shift in the strawberry fields of Californiaâ€™s central coast, she sprays herself down with Lysol, takes off the handkerchief she uses to protect her face, and tucks it in a plastic bag before getting in her car. Sheâ€™s the sole provider for her two young sons and canâ€™t afford to miss a day on the job. But these days, with the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the country, thatâ€™s getting much tougher. Carmelita carefully follows the safety precautions recommended by health experts, but thatâ€™s especially difficult in the fields. The farm where she works in Oxnard isnâ€™t enforcing safety protocols, the 44-year-old farmworker told Grist. (Carmelita requested that her last name be withheld because of fear of reprisals from her employer.) To make matters worse, her coworkers dismiss her repeated pleas that they maintain the expert-recommended six-foot distance from her. They laugh and tease her: â€œNothingâ€™s going to happen.â€ They tell her that, if she doesnâ€™t want to work, she should just go home. Carmelita, whose sons are 7 and 13, doesnâ€™t have that luxury. Every afternoon when she picks up her youngest from the babysitterâ€™s house, the first thing he does is run into her arms for a hug. The last thing Carmelita wants to do is infect him with the virus, but every day she runs that risk just to put food on the table for her sons â€” and the rest of California. Photo courtesy Carmelita â€œYouâ€™re trying not to get exposed, but unfortunately we donâ€™t have the ability to stop working,â€ Carmelita said in Spanish. â€œThe state calls us essential workers, but theyâ€™re not demonstrating our value. Weâ€™re putting ourselves at risk to feed the country.â€ As strawberry-picking season kicks into high gear in April and May, farmworker advocates fear that a lack of worker safety protections, combined with a lack of access to health care and crowded living conditions, could lead to a major COVID-19 outbreak in farmworker communities across California. As other crops are harvested throughout the spring, much of the rest of the country faces a similar risk. For a working population particularly vulnerable due to economic insecurity, exposure to pesticides, higher incidence rates of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, COVID-19 could be devastating. Article continues below More in this series A momâ€™s coronavirus coping strategy: Use your anger, mind your actions The 2020 census can help us fight climate change â€” if coronavirus doesnâ€™t get in the way How vulnerable is your community to coronavirus? These new maps reveal a familiar pattern. â€œIf we donâ€™t do something to address the living, working, housing, and transportation conditions of farmworkers immediately, we are setting ourselves up for a tremendous impact in the agricultural sector because these crops cannot be picked without farmworkers,â€ said Andrea Delgado, director of government affairs for the UFW Foundation (a nonprofit sister organization of the United Farm Workers union), which provides a range of services to farmworker and immigrant communities. At the federal and state level, the UFW Foundation has urged Congress and state governments to address the unique needs of farmworkers by providing relief that can both prevent the spread of the virus and help the workers survive the challenges ahead. There are more than 2.4 million farmworkers across the country, and itâ€™s estimated that about half are undocumented. In the most recent economic stimulus package, Congress earmarked $9.5 billion for the Department of Agriculture and $14 billion in loans for the agricultural industry, but Delgadoâ€™s concern is that none of this funding is specifically directed at farm laborers. The UFW Foundation is calling for Congress to provide farmworkers with hazard pay, financial support for childcare, and sick leave, among other benefits. Farmworkers on average earn about $10.60 per hour and have a median annual income between $17,500 and $19,999. Just 47 percent of farmworkers reported having health insurance, according to the latest National Agricultural Workers Survey. â€œRight now their situation â€” their legal status, their access to benefits â€” creates the conditions in which these workers are going to have to choose between going to work and making a living so that they can pay for a house, food, and childcare for their children, or staying home and taking care of themselves,â€ said Delgado. Farmworkers donâ€™t just work side by side â€” they often share living quarters to cut costs, doubling or tripling up in apartments, mobile homes, and houses. Many also carpool to work together, traveling long distances to reach orchards and fields in rural areas. â€œYou can imagine what the implications are for transmission, and their ability to stay healthy and safe, and provide for their families,â€ said Delgado. Workers en route to a farm in Californiaâ€™s Imperial Valley in 2014. Sandy Huffaker / Getty Images Food Shortages for Farmworkers As Americans have complied with stay-at-home orders, theyâ€™ve also rushed to stockpile groceries. One of the side effects is that farmworkers are facing an increased level of food insecurity. By the time workers finish their shifts, staples like beans and rice are sold out at grocery stores. Food pantries are also running out of food, according to farmworkers and advocates who spoke to Grist. Farmworkers in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley have watched this unfold. After 15 years of picking grapes and blueberries near her home in Delano, Susana stopped working about a month ago out of fear that she would get COVID-19. Her husband, who works on a dairy farm, is exposed to similar risks. But without Susanaâ€™s salary and with three children to feed, the couple canâ€™t afford to have him stay home. â€œWe never expected to go through something like this, and weâ€™re really worried about whatâ€™s happening. We donâ€™t go anywhere. We stay at home with our children,â€ Susana, who requested that her last name be withheld because she is undocumented, told Grist in Spanish. The family of six, which also includes Susanaâ€™s mother, is now struggling to make their money last on just one income. On some days, Susana canâ€™t afford to shop at the grocery store. She relies on local food banks, but they too run out of key staples quickly, she said. The fruit, milk, and lunch meals provided twice a week by her childrenâ€™s schools go a long way toward helping the family survive. But with school closures, low-income students who once received free breakfast and lunch meals on campus now get lunch just twice a week in areas such as Central California. To assist those in need, two schools that primarily serve the children of farmworkers in Delano are now offering breakfast to students and their parents, said Nancy Oropeza, a Delano-based organizer with the UFW Foundation. To survive, some families are now rationing or going without food, she said. â€œUnfortunately thatâ€™s a fact,â€ Oropeza told Grist. â€œMaybe they had enough food for the last week, but now theyâ€™re running out.â€ Organizations such Lideres Campesinas, a network of women farmworker leaders, are urging state leaders to take action, describing farmworkers as â€œone of the most vulnerable links in our nationâ€™s food supply chain, labor force, and citizenry.â€ In a letter sent to Governor Gavin Newsom this week, the Oxnard-based organization pressed state officials to prioritize the needs of farmworkers by addressing the inadequate levels of health education on COVID-19, the lack of access to health care, and food insecurity. The looming outbreak Advocacy organizations that serve farmworkers have been closely tracking the coronavirus, which has quickly spread to low-income, densely populated areas. In Californiaâ€™s Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, advocates have watched with concern as COVID-19 cases have surged in cities like Santa Maria and Oxnard, where many farmworkers work and live. â€œIf there is a major outbreak among agricultural worker communities it can spread really, really quickly,â€ said Lucas Zucker, policy and communications director for the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE), which advocates on behalf of immigrant, indigenous, and undocumented communities throughout Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. â€œI really worry about whatâ€™s going to happen as peak strawberry season coincides with this peak outbreak of COVID-19,â€ he added. â€œYou canâ€™t pick strawberries over Zoom.â€ That collision will deal a blow to a segment of the population that largely lacks not only health care, but also sometimes even the information on how to best protect themselves before or after exposure. Advocates have been encouraging growers to take â€œmeaningful stepsâ€ to protect farmworkers from coronavirus exposure by promoting workplace practices that prioritize workersâ€™ health and safety, but they say that many companies are not responding. The United Farm Workers union polled farmworkers via social media networks to determine whether employers are providing any coronavirus-related information. The union found that few are doing so, according to Armando Elenes, the organizationâ€™s secretary treasurer. Certain employers operating under union contracts have issued new guidelines, such as picking practices that require social distancing. But across the industry, the UFW says it has learned through its members that companies are not actually enforcing these best practices. In its March 30 letter to agricultural employers, the UFW called for extended sick leave, easy access to medical services as well as screening, testing, and treatment for non-union farmworkers who lack health care. Among farmworkers that CAUSE has surveyed, workers report that employers are providing safety measure briefings at the start of work shifts and are staggering people in the field rows. But even with these measures in place, Zucker pointed out that the nature of the work makes it difficult for the workers to comply. For example, during peak season employers pay workers by the box, creating a strong incentive for farmworkers to skip breaks. â€œThings like taking 20 seconds to wash your hands â€” it sounds like not that long. But when youâ€™re washing your hands itâ€™s a really long time, especially when you feel like you have to get out there to make a dollar to survive,â€ said Zucker. Beate Ritz, an occupational epidemiology expert at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, said itâ€™s very likely that the coronavirus will spread into working-class farming communities, based on existing transmission patterns. The impact of the coronavirus will be determined by how seriously the agricultural industry takes this health threat, whether they enforce safety measures, and what resources are directed at addressing issues such as health care access. â€œYou can have either a large outbreak and the whole system breaks down, or, as weâ€™re trying to do now by what they call the â€˜leveling of the curve,â€™ so that it doesnâ€™t peak too much, you can have it spread over time,â€ said Ritz. The Economic Policy Institute also warns that the peak in farm employment, which increases from spring through July, will overlap with the coronavirus peak. The nonpartisan think tank, which conducts economic research, concluded that employers will need to provide health insurance, paid sick days, and adequate safety equipment. The think tank argues that growers should also implement social distancing measures, even if some of these safety measures reduce productivity. â€œFarmworkers already labor under what can sometimes be dangerous and unhealthy conditions, and now COVID-19 presents an additional challenge,â€ the report stated. Many of the areas that employ farmworkers tend to be rural and lack the health care and other infrastructure to respond to a potential outbreak. In Washington state and California, the UFW Foundation is concerned that farmworkers wonâ€™t seek medical attention even if they have symptoms, because they lack health insurance or fear being deported. Some have never been treated by a medical doctor. â€œThese are folks that need to be working and canâ€™t afford not to work, even if they get sick,â€ said the UFW Foundationâ€™s Delgado. Staying the course In Oxnard, thatâ€™s the case for Carmelita, who plans to continue picking strawberries. Her sons depend on her, and nobody will forgive the payment thatâ€™s due on the room she rents in a shared mobile home. To make ends meet, sheâ€™s gotten creative. When school closures forced her to find alternative childcare for her sons, she couldnâ€™t afford the new expense. So she bought a video camera, installed it in the bedroom she rents, set up a study schedule for her 13-year-old, and monitors him via her cell phone during the day. What weighs on her is the possibility that she might get sick with COVID-19 and no longer be able to care for her sons. So she takes precautions at work to minimize the risk. In her free time she volunteers with Lideres Campesinas, ensuring that other farmworkers have access to potentially lifesaving information. â€œI know the risks that you face working in the fields due to pesticides,â€ said Carmelita, a native of Mexico who began picking grapes at the age of 13 on winter and summer breaks in her homeland. â€œSo Iâ€™m aware of the risk. But this type of risk, no.â€ These risks are what motivated her to work with organizations like Lideres Campesinas, so she could learn how to properly protect herself and others. Now, she just needs to convince her coworkers to do the same. â€œThe reality is that any of us can be exposed,â€ she said. This story was originally published by Grist with the headline Farmworkers are risking their lives to feed a nation on lockdown on Apr 4, 2020.
My husband and I were just talking about everything thatâ€™s in the news today. It is an overload on the brain. It used to be when we got married over 24 years ago I worried about everything! Keeping a roof and food to 3, trying to work to make the bills. I failed epically but thatâ€™s another post. ï¿¼ Yet, somehow Iâ€™ve made peace with the coronavirus. Maybe it is because I feel secure. Being married as long as we have makes me feel secure and loved. I am not alone. All I can do is keep myself away by sheltering in my own safe home. Thereâ€™s just two of us. Iâ€™ve got someone by my side to shelter beside. Today were using Target pick up. Rather than going inside getting the items. I have my prescriptions (and all health care items) mailed to me. Other items sent to me; UPS, USPS, FEDEX. When they arrive any outer packaging is removed before entering my home. We have a system of wiping or spraying with Lysol.ï¿¼ï¿¼ Some item bought in bulk are left outside for the required time for the Lysol to work â€¦â€¦or the virus to die by leaving it on the porch longer. It is not a heated porch. Books! Iâ€™ve just barely begun Testaments by Margaret Atwood. I canâ€™t wait to read her other works. All on Kindle on an IPad of coarse! It is April! My garden starting month. Iâ€™ve already planted a batch of arugula in the greenhouse. My fickle strawberries need transplanting. The greenhouse always needs a cleaning. My health is fickle. It all depends upon my oxygen saturation. Above 94 seems to be magical. Below Iâ€™m left exhausted without purpose. I cannot change this. I can only adapt to what is NOW. We used face masks, social distancing. Hand washing has always been important to us, even more now. I have made peace with what the coronavirus virus is. I have made peace with the possibility of being in an ICU bed desperately wanting oxygenâ€¦..without a ventilator. Iâ€™m too old, sick or any other reason. I have been there. I was on the edge of falling back into a big black vast entry point. I was going away. There was not a bright light. I had a choice to re-inflate my lung. It was an odd device to blow into. The confusion and delirium from lack of oxygen, kept inhaling from the device, not blowing in. It was all I could do. I survived. Iâ€™m here in my newly renovated kitchen making bread from scratch on the butcher block counters I have always dreamed of. Life gives only what you are strong enough to accept. Iâ€™ve made peace with this plague. It will never enter my territory. Chuck is home. We are safe. It is all good. I taught him to sew, together we are making masks to give to others. Twenty four years is a very long time to spend with someone. Time can test. Time often takes a toll. This day in time during a pandemic from the Coronavirus we didnâ€™t have to think about anything. We are working together for better or worse. On the flip side when we emerge there will be story to be told Iâ€™m sure.

RT @EspnDrunk: This guy's fighting coronavirus in Sandusky, OH with Lysol. These are the warriors we need right now âœŠ (Chuckie Soprano/FB)
@M2Madness Question!!! If the virus is so bad, why on the back of Lysol and Clorox cleaning wipes, says it disinfects the Human Coronavirus??
Of course @ChickfilA thought of this! Glad they did since hand sanitizer and Lysol wipes are darn near impossible to find right now. #COVID2019
Then they need to have someone handing out masks at the entrance. Sort of like how you can wipe your shopping cart with a Lysol wipe at stores.
I ABSOLUTELY adore this new Mr.Clean multipurpose cleaner scent â€œgainâ€ perfect combo with some bleach and Lysol wipesðŸ¥° No COVID-19 over here !
The scent of Lysol and Hand sanitizer, I call it Essence of Essential. #EssentialWorkers #EssentialEmployee #essentials #coronavirus #COVID19Pandemic
ðŸŽ¶We are family, I got all my sisters with meðŸŽ¶ #Squad #LockedNLoaded #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVID19Pandemic #NewProfilePic #Lysol #Clorox #Purell
Main issue is that Lysol is the only brand of air sanitizer I've seen. Other products may have the same chemicals but sanitize surfaces instead of air.
That would require even the slightest bit of reading comprehension from people who scream wHy DoEs LySoL KiLl CoRoNaViRuS If It WaS jUsT DiScOvErEd?!?!
We all bought so much Lysol and hand sanitizer and now I'm hearing this droplet transmission theory may not be true. Covid-19 may actually be airborne.
Stores are sold out of Lysol and other stuff but you can find bathroom cleaner with bleach still. Magic toilet paper must keep people safer or something.

@TheFive @DanaPerino @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Could the corona virus be transmitted thru the US mail? If so how should we treat it? Spray with Lysol?
@LibrtyBelle Everytime anyone has had the flu for decades itâ€™s the Coronavirusâ€”Look on the back of a can of Lysol. In it 19? Waiting for test results.ðŸ˜˜
@RagesNinja @Coronavirus_198 Well he follows me but he doesn't infect me i threatened him with lysol and he behaved. Also yes you can catch corona aswell.
It's biting me in the ass that I didn't pick up a few office supplies before this pandemic such as hand sanitizers and lysol wipes. I normally do this too.
I did a pick up order today and before they were brought in, they were sprayed with Lysol. Better safe than sorry. The main thing is to wash your hands often.
 @Lysol hi there. I got a case of this product but it is not listed on your website if it meets the criteria to use against covid-19 . Is it? Please advise . Thx !
Archeopthryx said: Can you not just get a can of Lysol and spray? If it was just as easy as just spaying everything then I would. But its more intensive than that.
Take Covid-19 serious! Wash twice a day use sanitizer after you touch anything everyday wipe ya home down with lysol wipes take a lot of vitamin C just be safe
Things I took for granted before coronavirus: being able to order pizza and eat it right away without having to bring the box outside to Lysol it before eating
really shitty for covid-19 to be going on during allergy season because if i have another co-worker run into my office with Lysol for coughing, Imma throw hands.
You are asking if the Lysol will liberate the viruses from the surface and create virus areosols? Most certainly not. But you shouldn't breath in the lysol anyways.

Yes your over reacting. The floors are safe. The car doors and steering wheel and interior buttons should be wiped down with Lysol or Clorox wipes since hands transfer germs.

Did the people wear gloves while making it? Did they Lysol it afterwards? How many people have touched it? Were said people wearing gloves? #covid19 ruins everything ðŸ˜ž
Clorox and Lysol been around since 1913 and 1889 if you have it in your house look on a can â€œHuman Coronavirusâ€ this shit been around this isnâ€™t whats going around rn
I donâ€™t think he was downplaying it. He said the panic, so all the people hoarding toilet paper and buying out lysol, meat etc to the point where no one else can buy any.
Is there coronavirus cases at the Lysol and Clorox factory...because I can't understand why the shelves are still EMPTY! And don't get me started with the Toilet Paper factory
Itâ€™s ok to Lysol her in the face RT @BeachMilk: Doing their very best to kills us all off, AND with a SMILE ON THEIR FACE TOO! #COVID-19 #Coronavirus #auspol #ChinaLiedPeopleDied
I feel like Clorox, Lysol, Purell and Charmin should just send every residence a care package of their products so we don't have to go out in search #covidshopping #coronavirus
@Foo1585 @GordonRussell1 @nwlaguy Coronavirus is the common cold. Some get more ill than others. Read the back of your ten year old Lysol can. C19 is simply a more dangerous version.
My mom will wipe off my Benadryl with Lysol wipes 10,000x to prevent me from getting corona virus but she had no problem ruining the way I think of myself for all eternity ðŸ¤”
I did mine with no gloves and a knock off Lysol that probably isn't as good as Lysol and haven't lost any to contain so far. Just keep everything fairly sterile and you'll be fine!
I straight up just found two tubs of lysol disinfectant wipes in my pantry and I got so excited because now i get to disinfect everything ðŸ˜‚ #COVID19ON #coronavirus #QuaratineLife
During all thatâ€™s going on, take a moment to be nice to someone. Spray someone with Lysol for their safety. Tell a random woman in a mask that she looks really pretty today. #COVID19

There's 13 cases of covid-19 in our area and that includes a postal worker who sorts our mail...effective yesterday i'm wiping all mails especially medication packages with lysol wipes...
They actually had some Lysol! And I bought a can for $6.79!!! #covid2019 #coronavirus #lysol (@ Pilot Travel Centers - @pilotflyingj in Rayville, LA) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/jfvd4bLC8bZ
I can see this as a commercial in 2030. Were you or someone you know overly exposed to hand sanitizer, Lysol or bleach during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic? You may be eligible for compensation.
Itâ€™d work as well as a Lysol wipe as thatâ€™s really all they are. Something that says on the packaging it will kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses. Soap and water would of course work.
@Safeway Have all Safeways stopped restocking Lysol Lemon Cleanser or just used it up keeping their stores clean?? Stuff seems to work great for coronavirus disinfecting. San Francisco customer.
@GNetDaGNet Well this is a new strand. The Lysol spray is an old strand..Iâ€™ve had patients w coronavirus but it wasnâ€™t this one thatâ€™s deadly. But still! Lock us tf down so we can have a summer!
if you rent from #EnterpriseRental, take special care: bring a bottle of #lysol to spray down the vehicle which may come from a hot state. Hell, spray anyway. Enterprise Staff may be lax. #coronavirus
Iâ€™m scared because now it seems like I canâ€™t smell. Iâ€™ve sprayed hella lysol and made ginger tea and I canâ€™t seem to smell it. Luckily I have an appt to go get tested tomorrow for COVID-19 ðŸ˜”
Yep. I did mention it's overpriced lol. I'm willing to pay the "Corona Tax" on this one personally. I finally got some Lysol disinfecting wipes from Amazon the other day too. Just need some masks now..
These started the original Coronavirus outbreak ( the one thatâ€™s on the side of the Lysol can) Thatâ€™s the reason you donâ€™t see them anymore . #staywoke while you #StayAtHome #QuarantineLife #5GKILLS
Coronavirus has been around for many years. Look on you Clorox and lysol products. It's there. The strain has mutated many times. We now have, I believe, 8 strands, but two of them are really dangerous.
living through the global covid-19 pandemic will have a lifelong impact on us. decades from now no one will understand why we insist on keeping extra lysol wipes & hand sanitizer stocked up at all times
I been yelled at for some tissue this morning & now I done walked into family dollar to a gathering of customers talking about the coronavirus on the Lysol can... like yâ€™all Iâ€™m just tryna get some pads

Keep in mind those Lysol wipes need time to work... depends on the formula but somewhere in the range of 5-10 MINUTES (check the label). You can't just give something a quick wipe and assume it's safe right away.

Old can of Lysol spray says it kills human #coronavirus. This virus has been around a long time in various forms. I was deathly sick several years ago and diagnosis was cold virus turned pneumonia or youâ€™ve got pneumonia ladidadida.

@FuctupMike Does anyone know why they changed the name from Coronavirus to Covid-19? Because people noticed coronavirus has been listed on lysol cans for a hundred years and is definitely not scary enough to make all you fools stay home.
Because no one has Lysol spray or alcohol wipes: 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water makes a very effective disinfectant. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html
SickNastyBastard said: I decided to not get the masks. The amount of work to properly sanitize on a constant basis is something I am too lazy to do; so the masks didn't seem like a good buy. Can you not just get a can of Lysol and spray?
So it's now recommended that we all wear masks outside but #Amazon isn't gonna sell 'em to the general public anymore and stores here in #NYC are pretty much out so...guess we're on our own. (week 2 w/ no lysol) #covid19 #coronavirus
Corona virus. Has been listed on the lysol containers since prior to that. This is a strain of that. And if you would actually read. I said if I'm not mistaken. If I was wrong I was wrong. I'm talking the actual virus. Not this strain.
1. What is COVID19 (Coronavirus)? Please explain in strong terms the impact. Our families are confused because, for example, Lysol claims to kill Coronavirus, we realize it is a Novel Coronavirus, but we should be using the phrase COVID19.

My question about #COVID19 is.. when can we expect to have lysol sprays and wipes again? Also doesn't America produce our own masks? I thought our country could manufacture everything how come we don't have so many things? #COVID19Pandemic
Exactly, Dr Adams is saying to leave groceries out for a while, and spray them down when possible, to minimise transmission of Coronavirus. I myself do this. I have a dwindling bottle of Lysol, which I use on anything brought into the house.

#COVID19 Taught me some valuable lessons : 1. If you can afford pedicures and wigs, you can afford to stash a way an emergency fund. 2. Have a food emergency kit (enough canned food for 2 weeks, etc) . That's more important than lysol and toilet paper!

@realDonaldTrump Lysol products have stated for years their product kills "Human Coronavirus" Something is a miss. This new coronavirus appears to have been genetically engineered in some laboratory. We need to find the labs that are making this virus and close them down.
I should have clarified! I meant disinfectant, rather than specifically anti-bacterial. Clorox/ Lysol/ etc are not just anti-bac, they also kill viruses. Today I read a recommendation that suggested using disinfectants to sanitize commonly touched surfaces in your home.
I was wondering about Lysol, cardboard, silver. I don't want Lysol on the Silver and I'm not sure how it's packaged inside. I'm leaning toward a quarantine. I'll put it inside some plastic right away, using gloves, then let sit for some days. Thanx for your thoughts tho

Carole Lynne Parrish there are instructions to wash in hot water and dry on high to kill any particles. Apparently covid19 goes away with heat. Plus Iâ€™d spray lysol on them before even bringing them in house or washer. And washer will have bleach added. Iâ€™m a Germaphobe.
Switched from lemon to orange Lysol cleaner. Its less overpowering if you use a lot. Honestly though, this is still much more freedom than last years Feb arctic blast. So "normal" until the weather hits 15, and then its going to suck if these restrictions are still in place.

Ok hereâ€™s one orange, hereâ€™s two in the basket now. When I put (add) two more oranges in the basket the total is 4 oranges. Thatâ€™s why 2+2=4. Yâ€™all donâ€™t learn everything like THAT anymore. You just fucking remember like that the CDC says Lysol kills coronavirus so buy Lysol
They got the Lysol RT @660NEWS: So far, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on First Nations in Alberta and the government is working to keep it that way. https://www.660citynews.com/2020/04/02/provincial-government-working-with-first-nations-to-ensure-case-count-stays-at-zero/
Same. You'd think after 3 weeks I would run up on ONE measly can of Lysol or canister of clorox wipes, but no dice. Not that I've gone looking dozens of times, but this goes for online as well. I know stores still get shipments! What gives? We will be out of hand sanitizer in a few weeks
ðŸ‘‰1000 people dying a day in the United States from #coronavirus. and NO ONE can easily find hand sanitizer, Lysol, wipes, or paper towels! Basicï¿¼ stuff in dire short supply here in USA. Shocking to me. Itâ€™s also shocking that weâ€™re not talking about it more. What can be done?!
@1upSAVAGE The virus & 5g have a invisible connection. Both are real & both are convenient you can't call the coronavirus fake when it's on the back of Lysol cans we can't be that simple but timing is everything and this just seems to have impeccable timing & the correlation also impeccable
HOLD UP. Coworker is wearing latex gloves due to coronavirus. BUT he doesnâ€™t change them each time, he sprays lysol on it and says theyâ€™re â€œgood as newâ€. This motherfucker KEPT his gloves on while using the restroom. He came out and fucking used hand sanitizer with the gloves on
RT @KrisColvin: Okay I have some info. Lysol is hard to come by, but I have just ordered this and travel spray bottles. It has been tested for coronavirus to disinfect and is what they use in salons. I got it on amazon. https://barbicide.com/barbicide-statement-regarding-human-coronavirus/

We got Lysol wipes at Walmart last Thursday. They didnâ€™t have TP though. Read on the local reddit one of the Costco has TP but no lysol. Ok weâ€™re going to Costco next week and if we manage to find TP that should be fine for the rest of the pandemic imo, still have s***tier superstore tp as well.

The coronavirus is a blanket name. The word coronavirus is on the back of a Lysol can all it means is â€œcommon coldâ€ this is how misinformation gets around ðŸ™„ RT @Latifajunho: OMG!!!!

Strip on the porch, clothes in the washer, then a shower. I disinfect the door handles, keys, belt, leather-man holster, phone and all that stuff with lysol wipes and or spray bottle of alcohol. told everyone to stay away from me at work, printed big signs for the next time I go back to remind them to stay away.
Tell her that you're social distancing and ton stay 6 feet away from you and to not talk in your direction. If she throws something at you, yell Coronavirus and let that shit fall and refuse to pick it up. Then spray lysol all around. Tell her if she touches anything around you again, you will consider it assault.

Homemade masks. Wash your hands before touching anything else. Wipe down doorknobs/faucets/toilet levers/toilet seats with any bleach or Lysol if you have it. If you don't use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol w/at least 60%. If not that, any soap/HOT water scrub down for at least 20 seconds will break the fat off coronavirus.

This needs more upvotes. Make your own masks! My family got together two weeks ago and decided that we needed masks.

Jey Hernandez Yes I said that the coronavirus been around but that people don't understand its more than one type of coronavirus. Like the COVID-19, the coronavirus that just came out in 2019 not the original coronavirus that's on the lysol cans this is a different coronavirus that not even a can of lysol can kill because the coronavirus on the lysol cans is the original coronavirus that already existed, people don't understand COVID-19 is a new strain of COVID. That's what I been trying to say.
1. Dress in full hazmat suits. 2. Spray yourself down with Lysol. 3. Attach your own air supply to your head covering. 4. Keep a 6-ft stick with you to smack people in the legs with if they are too close. 5. Hose your car down with bleach when you get home. ðŸ˜Š RT @WSJ: Deliveries are safer during the coronavirus pandemic, but sometimes a store visit is unavoidable. Here are the precautions to take.
Leslie Raine Quick Coronaviruses have been around for years. There are 7 known strains that affect humans. Four of them cause common cold symptoms. The other 3 are deadly, and they include MERS, SARS, and SARS-2 aka Covid-19. That's why Lysol already lists Coronaviruses on its can. They've been around a long time. This was just a new one to jump from animals to humans. All Coronaviruses come from animals.
Thanks for the technical data. But quick question. If lysol wipes require that kind of time to sanitize, how in the world are they effective at all seeing as the residue te wipes leave behind seems to evaporate almost instantly. And with bleach, if using it, do I drench said area with bleach then let it sit for minutes THEN wipe up? Also since you seem to know your stuff, what would you recommend differently?
Yes. I spent a half hour trying to figure out how to order airborne. Costco had it. But you can only get it instore. You cannot order it. But then I went to my store to order through Instacart and not available. Itâ€™s a unicorn I guess. You can only get Lysol or Chlorox in store. Idk. It makes no sense that I can see. I am not buying anything else this month, we are just going to deal. I like to Lysol the mail. Which sounds crazy.

Same. The best was a scan I did through a glass door, the customer held the ID against the glass, I mimed for her to turn it over, I scanned it and then scribbled a signature for her. No way Iâ€™m risking getting COVID, or risking our customers by possibly giving it to them if Iâ€™m an asymptomatic carrier. Iâ€™ve seen tons of customers Lysol the bags before they bring them in, and to me, Iâ€™m not offended at all; theyâ€™re playing it safe as they should.
Actually what everyone needs to know and wake up to is thatLYSOL KILLS THE HUMAN CORONAVIRUS AND THE SARS CORONAVIRUS... Why isn't this being publicized it's on the can of Lysol...

I went to the store and they were just putting out Toilet paper I hadn't seen any for quite a qhile. So ofcourse I got some. Got home and just refreshed walmart disinfectant wipes page and saw a 3 pack of lysol wipes available. Got my order in then they were sold out again. Feels like christmas day. Never thought I'd say that about toilet papaer and wipes... Unless someone got that order of wipes in right before i did and mine gets cancelled then it'll be a crappy xmas.

Lysol wipes in the work van. Wiping down the gas pump before pumping. Bought lots of soda and snacks with groceries so I am not tempted to stop at the convenience store. Wipe down things after service calls, trying to only take no heat emergency repairs, pushing out indoor routine maintenance as long as possible, couple months hopefully. I have been buying groceries at least 2 weeks at a time, also buying for my father in law, he is high risk old guy, trying to keep him at home.
Kroger on Middlebrook has a decent stock of most things now. Ramen noodles, lysol sprays, clorox/lysol wipes, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper are out of stock almost all the time still. Paper Towels are hit or miss. Hand Soap are still mostly gone. Food wise I think you're safe to go here though. Meats are limited 2 per person iirc. I was just there yesterday so this is recent. Make sure you bring your own wipes for the buggies if you have any. They're out of wipes even for their own store.

Archeopthryx said: Can you not just get a can of Lysol and spray? No. If you're wearing a mask with the outside filters getting liquid into it isn't the best idea. Too much water especially can turn it to goop that won't work anymore. You really need a place that you can take the mask off from the back, remove the filters and put them into a bag, then wash the central part of the mask. They're usually rubber-plastic and relatively easy to clean on their own. Stick you filters out in the sun where they can't get wet or leave them in a bag for a while or get one of those UVC lights and illuminate the shit out of them to 'clean ' them.

Ivan Shatov said: Skid row infections in Southern CA have been a thing since January. A friend of mine is an EMT near San Diego. There's a group of other EMTs throughout the state, they share notes on strange goings-on. They've been picking up bums dying of pneumonia, taking them to ERs, only for the bums to get stabilized and discharged back onto the streets. Some percentage of them were positive and died in gutters. A larger percentage found their way to shelters and infected others. A smaller percentage were sent to other cities. Completely serious with this next part - there's a segment of EMTs / med techs / doctors who believe these people need to be put in camps or euthanized for the good of everyone else. Most homeless in CA are addicts, legally insane or Mexican, they just can't take care of themselves and have a bizarre reason to spread the disease. Watch mortality rates in ERs over the next few months, the spike will be significantly above average compared to the rest of the Nation. I wonder if that high mortality rate in NYC is partially due to the homeless that cycle in and out of shelters in the winter. Archeopthryx said: Can you not just get a can of Lysol and spray? Lysol is as scarce as alcohol, masks and nitrile gloves in NYC.
"I have a severely immune compromised, asthmatic child that I am trying to protect at all costs.
I have left to get curb side groceries, I lysol and clean and throw away bags. I lysol my mail, anything coming into my home.

The state of the world without THIS vaccine should be terrifying to anyone.
Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m hurting my child, this is the reason she stays so sick Bc of the precautions I take.
Iâ€™m a single parent and lost my job to this. Iâ€™m almost thankful, even tho I do not qualify for any help, Iâ€™m almost thankful I can protect her more.
Sheâ€™s had flu a&b, strep 6 times, bronchitis, a few respiratory infections, idk how many asthma attacks that required ER visits. Thatâ€™s just this winter. Not the span of her life.
Posts like this terrifies me, that people arenâ€™t scared of this. My child would be on a vent. And I cannot stomach that thought.
We have been self quarantined for 3 weeks, and she now is on antibiotics for strep throat, an ear infection, and a respiratory infection thatâ€™s flaring her asthma.

Iâ€™ve been told my vaccinating my child cause her issues now. I have 2 more perfectly healthy vaccinated children. Actually in 8 years her twin has had one ear infection. She says sheâ€™s â€œtoo mean to get sickâ€

Iâ€™ve gone off on my soap box because anti vaxxers are just mind blowing. Just stupidity."

Too late, Lysol that has corona on its label is sold out... Ok, so you've answered your own question, but I'll volunteer an answer on behalf of the UN anyway. The UN probably regret naming the first outbreak "SARS" because, as is blindingly obvious now, that is just a generic term. I get SARS every evening when I climb up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire, but after 10 minutes I'm cured again. Influenza is also a generic term, which is why we have "Spanish 'flu" to denote a particularly significant strain - you may have heard of it? This time, finally, they have got it right. COVID-19 will either be a one-off, like 9/11, that we will always remember. Or it may indeed re-appear at some future date, possibly starting out from..... Norway... or Australia...or Iceland. And suddenly the name "Wuhan virus" is no longer appropriate. Likewise a new date could be added so that it becomes COVID-26 (assuming it strikes in 2026) Or it gets a new name entirely if it is no longer a corona-virus. With the world's population ever increasing, and air travel becoming easier, it is almost inevitable that pandemics will become more frequent and more destructive. And original sources less and less clear. What price a French national starting a disease half way across the Pacific whilst flying back & forth between Tokyo and LAX (after eating a meal of Argentine beef) ? Who gets the credit for that one? Let's hope the same does not apply to the USA releasing the virus in Wuhan, that rumour is also being repeated a lot. Repeated "a lot" ? Then you need to find a better source for your news! In my world it was mentioned a handful of times only, a week or so back, along with clear indications it was just mud-stirring by the Chinese, and since then I've heard NOTHING. Are you perhaps relying too much on Chinese (or possibly Russian) news sources? I can't think of anyone else still carrying this story. p.s. "rumour"? You are the second one today displaying curious spellings. Wot is occurring here?

This article was produced in partnership with the Anchorage Daily News, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network. Later this spring, Alaskaâ€™s Bristol Bay will blossom into one of the largest annual salmon fisheries in the world. The regional population of about 6,600 will triple in size with the arrival of fishermen, crews and seasonal workers on jets but also private planes and small boats, many traveling from out of state. And yet the heart of the health care system in southwestern Alaska, in a corner of the state where the Spanish flu once orphaned a generation, is a 16-bed hospital in Dillingham operated by the Bristol Bay Area Health Corp. Only four beds are currently equipped for coronavirus patients. As of Wednesday the hospital had a few dozen coronavirus tests and for the entire Florida-sized region, tribal leaders said. If those newly arrived workers need to quarantine for two weeks, as mandated by the state, residents said itâ€™s unclear where everyone will hunker down. Local store shelves are already bare of Clorox, Lysol and rubber gloves. Dillingham, the largest community in the Bristol Bay region with a population of 2,300, is 320 miles from Anchorage by air. â€œWeâ€™re scared. â€¦ People come from all over the world for Bristol Bay fishing,â€ said Gayla Hoseth, second chief for the Dillingham-based Curyung Tribal Council. â€œThereâ€™s 7,000 of us who live here, and this hospital cannot handle the 7,000 of us if we get sick. Imagine (when) our population triples and quadruples in the summertime.â€ Dillingham, Alaska. (Bill Roth/Anchorage Daily News) Compounding matters, the hospital executive who ran daily operations for the health care system is out of a job after downplaying the coronavirus threat to colleagues. A March 16 email from the executive â€” which repeated a conspiratorial meme suggesting the coronavirus is somehow a politically motivated phenomenon â€” set flame to a deep anxiety among some tribal leaders over the vulnerability of Alaska villages in a pandemic. â€œJust a reminder that FLU kills many every year!â€ wrote Lecia Scotford, who was the chief operating officer. (The coronavirus is not like the flu. It appears to be more contagious and more lethal.) Watch This Video The message soon began to circulate in the Bristol Bay region, drawing a blistering response from some tribal and local leaders. Robert Clark, president and chief executive of Bristol Bay Area Health Corp., said Scotfordâ€™s last day was Monday. He would not say if she was fired, citing â€œpersonnel stuff,â€ but said â€œshe was separated.â€ Scotford did not respond to emails, phone calls and Facebook messages requesting comment. Her email to lists of â€œdivision managersâ€ and â€œdepartment managersâ€ within the regional health organization also emphasized the need for calm, common sense and good hygiene, and for the hospital to be prepared to serve the public. â€œThat (email) was very concerning to me because that kind of lets peopleâ€™s guard down,â€ Norman Van Vactor, president of the Bristol Bay Economic Development Corp., said in a phone interview.

Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick. Bristol Bay is a magnet for people in the summer, with a seasonal migration of about 13,000 workers for the lucrative fishing season. The commercial salmon fishery here is the largest in the state, but as of 2010, about 60% of earnings went to out-of-state permit holders. Almost all the major Bristol Bay seafood processing companies are based in Seattle, an early hot spot for coronavirus, and two thirds of Bristol Bay processing workers live in West Coast states at other times of the year, according to the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game forecasts some 34.6 million sockeye salmon will be harvested there this year. â€œWhen it comes to wild salmon, we are over half the worldâ€™s sockeye and over half of the Alaska salmon value,â€ said Andy Wink, executive director for the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association. The nonprofit industry group on Thursday issued an advisory urging the fleet to delay travel to Bristol Bay until May 1. â€œKeep in mind, it is possible to carry this virus without symptoms and unknowingly infect others leading to overtaxed medical capacity and/or death(s),â€ the advisory said. â€œYou do NOT want to be the outsider photographed or seen around town in public spaces if this situation turns for the worst,â€ the group warned its fishermen. Wink said his nonprofit is working with local governments on a plan to avoid overcrowding Bristol Bay Area Health Corp. clinics and the Dillingham hospital with sick fishermen, processors and support workers. â€œWe are taking the stance that we donâ€™t want to rely on the local clinics or if we do, the need to be bolstered substantially,â€ Wink said. As the health care provider for the region, Bristol Bay Area Health Corp. operates the only regional hospital and the clinics in 21 surrounding villages. It employed 470 people and reported revenue of $76.7 million in 2017, according to a tax form that Scotford submitted to the IRS. Clark, the health corporation chief executive, said the Dillingham hospital is seeking more equipment to meet the potential for coronavirus patients among the local and visiting fishing industry patients. Chief nursing officer Lee Yale said the hospital had 37 tests on hand as of Wednesday, and that all tests performed had returned negative. The Dillingham facility has no ICU beds, four negative pressure rooms to treat COVID patients without infecting others, plus two ventilators for the region. â€œWe have staffing but if they get ill we will be in a tight spot,â€ she wrote in an email. â€œ(The) fishing industry will devastate our surge plan and we can not support and cover our villages if this season opens.â€ Meantime, for many in Bristol Bay, the looming COVID-19 threat recalls family histories of death and loss in the face of past epidemics. The Spanish flu wracked the U.S. in 1918 and 1919, including this Kansas hospital, above. Residents of Bristol Bay are descendants of Spanish flu survivors. (Wikimedia Commons) â€œWe are the survivors of the survivors of the orphans of the Spanish flu,â€ said Hoseth, the Dillingham tribe second chief. Another member of the tribe, tribal administrator Courtenay Carty, said her great-grandmother was orphaned in Dillingham by the 1919 flu , and raised by teenage cousins, and her grandfather was orphaned by tuberculosis in the 1940s. â€œThe fact that all of our contemporary families are descendants of those children and few adults that survived 1919 is one of (the) major reasons why we are so passionate about protecting ourselves from this pandemic,â€ she said. â€œWhat is history to others is our tribal and familial identities.â€ Her tribe declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 24, calling for a stop to all but essential travel to the city.

"Yeah, I do tend to check a couple times a day.  I actually switched my Amazon tab to the Solimo Hand Sanitzer page as I had noticed some others were in stock, but only for hospitals, but I had a feeling they might make some available to customers too,  and I guessed right.

I got lucky with the Lysol wipes I guess. I just do a random search every now, and then, and it was in stock, but sold out very quickly after I ordered. I'd still like to get a Lysol spray too, so I do a search for that now too."
How is it that, no matter when or where I got to the store, there is NEVER any disinfectant cleaner? I mean never. Supermarket, Target, Walmart, Costco, drug stores - nobody has it. Have they stopped making it? Who is buying it out on a daily basis? Assuming each store serves their local area, you would think everyone bought their supplies and restocking would be possible. But no. I don't even bother looking for hand sanitizer or cleaning wipes. Just a Lysol spray for my office would be great. Maybe some day....

Thank you! Yeah itâ€™s just hard because we still allow carry-out customers too and so Iâ€™ll be changing gloves and using hand sanitizer 300 times a day. Someone at our store delivered to a woman who sprayed her cash with Lysol, on his way back to the store he called the woman and asked if she had the virus and she said yes. That was what prompted me the choice to stay home. People are really dumb. I caught the flu in January due to somebody who was sick ordering, and me catching that flu got one of my roommates sick too.

Good lord.ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ 1. Stop being so paranoid. If you are that concerned, then don't order anything. 2. Just let it sit in the sun for a day or two. COVID-19 is not particularly hardy, and is unable to survive on open surfaces like cardboard beyond a few hours. Sunlight is particularly unfriendly to most microorganisms. Do not bother with Lysol. If you are *still* paranoid, wipe it down with rubbing alcohol, or a 1:3 bleach solution. Or, you know, just don't lick the package, and wash your hands before you eat or touch your face.
This is just a lack of testing. My family is African and I can tell you for a fact the health system over there is wack lol. My Uncle (who got his medical degree here in the US) does a lot of work back home getting super basic health infrastructure set up. The reality is that this will infect the majority of the world population whether we experience symptoms or not. Numbers that low will pretty much only come from low levels of testing. And the sanitation issues in most African countries go beyond what can be combated by air dropping Lysol.
Yeah, and you're allowing people to buy by the CASE. No minimum. Yesterday, my husband was behind a lady who had a case of Lysol AND Clorox wipes. She took out one for the cashier to scan, and walked out with the two cases. SHAME Throckmortons of Dry Tavern location!

Hand sanitizer in the truck and Lysol wipes. Wearing a mask and washing hands often. Shoes stay in the garage and will be thrown out after this. I wear scrubs at work, n95, face shield , double gloves and hazmat gown when anywhere close to a positive patient. Oxavier wipes on all the equipment twice before working on it. I take off all my clothes and they go straight into the wash. My wife will probably live in a camper for the 6 weeks when she gets called too the icu or field hospital. All groceries that arenâ€™t perishable stay in the garage. Fresh food gets washed in vinegar or repackaged right away.

Seriously, I did not know such a huge majority of people were unclear on how respiratory mist works. Of course Trump didn't know, but the media consults medical experts all the time. Did they ignore this part because everyone's too focused on spraying their mail with Lysol? RT @CNN: A prestigious scientific panel told the White House Wednesday night that research shows coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes or coughs, but also just by talking, or possibly even just breathing. https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/health/aerosol-coronavirus-spread-white-house-letter/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2020-04-02T13%3A06%3A34&utm_source=twCNN
Do i really need to sanitize all of my groceries? I've read a lot of articles stating that they don't think it's necessary, and even heard Dr Fauci say so in an interview. But i keep seeing people on the internet leaving their groceries outside for 3 days, spraying down boxes with disinfectant, wiping packages with Lysol wipes. And everyone else panicking is making me feel like i'm being too lax. I actually caved today and instead of going to the store myself tomorrow, i ordered groceries for pick up, which i won't be ready until next thursday. Idk, i wanna be safe but i'm also an trying not to overreact because i know what that'll do to my already fragile mental state.
So I usually stock up on TP, with about 2-4 months worth at a time. It just so happens I will be running out in about 5 days or so. I also stock up on germx, I now only have about a 2 weeks supply. I also stock up on Lysol, I now only have a few day supply left. I have always been cautious about germs because of my often skin infections. I germx my hands after I leave the train etc. People are pissing me off. You bastards were dirty and now you're trying to act more like me and you bought up all the shit lol Seriously, how could tp still be sold out? Three weeks of heavy buying...there is at least a sizable portion of Americans who have AT LEAST a 6 month supply right now.
You may want to specify which Simple Green you are talking about to u/BeetleDeetz so they are not accidentally misinformed. I looked up the regular Simple Green that most people use and associate with the term "Simple Green" (All Purpose Cleaner Concentrate, Green liquid) and it **does not kill COVID-19.** [SimpleGreen Website FAQ's](https://simplegreen.com/news-and-media/coronavirus-faq/) **Q: Can Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner be used against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?** No. Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is not a disinfectant.

Do you enjoy insulting people on the internet? Learn to recognize sarcasm. Your simpleton has surgical masks (one box disposable / one reusable), latex gloves, one face shield, one goggle, raincoat, lysol wipes, oximeter, oxygen concentrator device, and a stocked fridge. Not to mention my Vitamin D, C, E, probiotics, and tumeric supplements. I've been prepping since China locked down Wuhan. Most recently I got hands on an individual dosage of hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for one week. US doctors are behind the eight ball and not prescribing the drugs early enough and at not high enough of a dosage (300mg instead of 600mg by Chinese doctors). So don't worry ... my head is not in the sand.
"Here is the EPA's list of products approved to fight the virus which causes COVID-19: [https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2)

It's a long list, but if you type 'Lysol' into the search bar, for example, you'll see all Lysol wipes are approved.

Antibacterial wipes work for the same reason that hand sanitizer works: *this particular virus* has an outer envelope that can get broken up by certain substances, like the alcohol in hand sanitizer gel. In the case of wipes, one of the most common active ingredients in hand wipes is quaternary ammonium, which also breaks down that outer envelope."
It isnâ€™t as much a change of heart, as much as I donâ€™t want my 92 year old grandmother, and my 72 year old mother and father to not die all the sudden. We had a great time at the beach, but we social distanced, wore gloves when getting gas, and Lysolâ€™d every hotel room. I just get aggravated by people referring to the as the â€œtypical fluâ€ or an over reaction. We have a flu vaccine. If we didnâ€™t, it would kill millions each year. This one is not â€œa fluâ€. We will beat it, but it will come at a cost. We are paying that cost now...but itâ€™s worth it to save live. Iâ€™ve never been a big Trump person, but he is treating this correctly, in my opinion. Donâ€™t take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.
Being an essential worker, I am out and about Monday though Friday. Obviously that is a risk for my family at home but I feel that we have adapted a strategy that works well. Upon entering my car at the end of the day I sanitize my hands with hand sanitizer and lysol the typical spots (steering wheel, stick, etc.) Upon entering our home I immediately disinfect my boots, strip down and throw the clothes directly in the wash, and hit the shower. It may seem a bit extreme but our youngest has had some serious go around with pneumonia due to is weak immune system. I've already seen him on a ventilator once, don't want to go through that again. I'm interested, for those deemed essential and still heading out every day, what are some ways you're attempting to keep your home COVID19 free?
"Just thought I'd give an anonymous shout out to my connect today and ask a favour. 

He turned up during the early afternoon, within a couple of hours of messaging him in NYC during the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown. I normally hop in his car on exchange, so was expecting a quick transaction to minimize us sharing a tight space. I had a spare bottle of hand sanitizer in my place that I brought down on a whim, to give it to him in case he didn't have one. 


He turns up fully stocked though. Wearing surgical gloves, some type of facemask on and lysol wipes in the cup holder and hand sanitizer bottles everywhere. The seat and door had clearly just been wiped down with the lysol. I gave him the bottle and he must have been happy to add to his supplies because he gave me this. 

Any guess on what TPV might mean? https://imgur.com/o8riwbY.jpg"
I am a high risk person, so anxiety and depression has hit hard. I have not been outside in over two weeks. Not to even get the mail. I don't trust our government or CDC. This virus being what it is how do they know? One day they say no mask for everyone then they say mask. They say your good if your 6ft apart, but how do they know? They say your safe, now they say you can get it by talking to people. They say the wipes and Lysol spray does not kill COVID19, but it spray it in your mail and packages. The truth is they know nothing. They are hoping you will be safe out walking, but reality they don't know. I choose to be my own advocate. Stay inside. I stand in the doorway out back for fresh air. My anxiety and depression will continue to get worse. I do not even get or touch my mail. Its not worth the chance. Please stay home. May Gods grace and love be with all of you.
Personally I would feel better if it was truly acknowledged legally that schools were not closed early enough, we were then asked to go to work in buildings that weren't cleaned and had reported cases of positive virus. Not to mention keeping us in close quarters, no supplies like Lysol and sanitizer, no ventilation! Then Carranza telling administration not to tell us about positive cases. Just SMH and so disgusted in the manner which we were treated and are still being treated like we are expendable and don't matter. That is the message I have received loud and clear....that our lives don't matter. At least not giving us spring break doesn't put our lives at risk. Having us go into work unnecessarily put our lives and health at risk. Just unbelievable!!! I can't even put into words how upset I am. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nyc-teacher-coronavirus_n_5e711f76c5b60fb69ddf6d02
He did a lot of mistakes. First, wearing long sleeves and letting them touch the items. Then he could only wash his hands instead of going up his arms. Yes, the chicken and other paper packaging. He kept flipping around the plastic bags, too. Iâ€™d have sprayed Lysol on the chicken package, left it alone an hour and then cooked it. That snack box, again spray the outside well because it looked like some may have become contaminated especially with him shaking the box into the bowl. Just no. That cereal could have stayed outside. The pizza box needed to be sanitized before he struggle opening it. The produce needed soap. I havenâ€™t bought any produce that canâ€™t be washed, peeled and cooked. No way would I buy that lettuce or whatever the greens were. That one little wipe isnâ€™t going to get all that food done and do NOT put it on the counter by the sink. So much wrong with his last video it should be deleted.

The frozen and perishable stuff you can deal with immediately. If you have any bleach and a spray bottle, make a solution of dilute bleach spray. There are probably recipes on the net for this. I repurposed spray bottles to have a few. You can also use lysol if you have it. Spray the bags down, especially the handles. Using gloves or a wipe, remove the perishables and place them on the sidewalk. Spray the outside of the perishable packages and let them sit for 3-4 minutes (remaining damp). Roll them over and spray the bottom. Wipe down and place in freezer/fridge. nonperishable stuff can sit for a week or 10 days. IF you have a large cooler type thingie, put it in there to keep â€˜many legged friendsâ€™ out. Otherwise, spray down the bags really good and stash them, unpacked, for a few days. Make sure you donâ€™t inadvertently touch the packaging while moving them. Wear gloves if you have to and I use hand sanitizer on the gloves before I remove them. YMMV, of course. We havenâ€™t dealt with grocery store in a while but this is what we did the very last trip we made. Since then weâ€™ve gotten a few boxes delivered. I spray them down on the driveway and leave them for 15m or so, spray them again (need to make sure they remain damp), roll them over, ditto ditto. Let them sit another hour or so and then let them quarantine in my garage for 10 days or so.
"New Jersey

There are a few dozen cases in the city I live in-- a coach/gym teacher from my cousins' high school got the virus and died despite being only in his 30s and very fit/athletic. A doctor from North Bergen also has it and is critical at the hospital. In addition, an old couple **in the apartment complex I live in** (I live on the 8th floor, the couple on the 2nd floor) got it and are now in critical condition at the hospital. My grandmother lives on the 1st floor, and I worry endlessly about her health.

I haven't left the house for 3 weeks or so (I'm relatively chill, although I am anxious), and my college classes from my soon-to-be alma mater in NYC have been moved online. I have a few friends holed up in NY right now, unable to leave the city or state due to quarantine measures, including a girl whose family is in Germany. I voluntarily decided to stay home rather than go to my retail job because of the insanity at the supermarkets (thankfully, my manager understands). Last time I was there, TP was gone in a few hours, alongside the Lysol, hand sanitizer, and the water. Eggs and meat were limited, and fruits were flying off the shelves.

Despite this madness, there are people within my apartment who are still treating this virus like it's nothing. I sometimes see people walking outside, or driving, as if everything's still normal. This is going to end badly, because of these idiots."
Jeff. Please stop inhaling that Lysol. We can not blame President Trump for you liberals shutting down all non essential services. Ironic the states with highest job loss are all run by Democrats. lol. Yes, Corona virus is proving to be a bigger problem than we had hoped but I guess you Dumborats were wrong for criticizing Trump when he started placing travel bans. Did Fed stabilize stock market? Well, stock market did take a big jump today thanks to, "Your" President Donald Trump working to stabilize the price of oil. No, not everyone works for the big oil companies but you should try getting off your ass and seeing how many people in America work in the oil industry including transportation and construction. True, many people lost their jobs in other industries greatly thanks to your liberal closing of non essential service by Democrat cities and states but we had to stabilize the oil market or the job loss would be higher. BTW dumb dumb, oil industry is not the only thing, "Your" President is trying to fix. Job loss is temporary but by saving so many big corporations, the hope remains that when this crisis is under control, those companies will open their doors hiring back millions of people currently unemployed. That's how capitalism works dumb dumb. Now if we could only get you people to smarten up and help get our economy moving again because the problem is people like you. Thanks for your time dumb dumb.

Update: yeah, she's a miserable hypocrite and she has to go. At first she was complaining that I had my belongings on the counter, so I moved them, and now HER belongings are all over the counter. It's the same amount of stuff, just 100% of hers and 0% of mine. She also griped at me a few days ago about how I left some dishes soaking in the sink and also left a pan on the stovetop overnight (to avoid disturbing her by washing it while she was sleeping; it was clean except for a smear of vegetable oil). Now I don't let anything soak; I scrub everything and dry it and put it away immediately, even if it's super-greasy or hard to clean. But now she's complaining that I left a (clean) baking sheet on the stovetop again -- because \\*the sink was full of her dishes\\* overnight, and I couldn't wash anything. One set of rules for her, another for me. To make matters worse, she opens the bathroom door right after using the bathroom, then goes into the kitchen to wash her hands. (What the hell??) I have to Lysol the bathroom doorknob like ten times a day and I can't even say anything to her about any of this because she's so volatile and angry. I'm so uncomfortable in my own home, it's outrageous. I'm going to try to be the bigger person and wait out the estimated COVID-19 apex on this one, so I will terminate her sublease effective May 15. I realize I can't force her to go, but I don't think she's going to fight it, because she seems to irrationally hate me anyway.
Yeah thats in the news up here more and more. We haven't even hit our *regular* capacity yet but they forecast some pretty bad-case-scenario s***, including: -national shortage on ventilators -provincial (alberta) stock of basic PPE like Tyvek suits and N95 masks to last until June, then we are out unless we get replenished. Knowing a bit about supply chain and the big boys that make these things (3M, Honeywell, etc) it should be no problem at all, not just for us but all of north america. I went to wallmart today (Westbrook if Deli is reading this) at 2pm and waited 10 minutes. They had 10 foot hash marks in the mall for people to line up. It was sorta surreal. They were putting the same hash marks in food ailes, which i expect them to start enforcing in the coming days. As for stock, we are basically all good now. Except for Lysol. You can't buy lysol branded anything (wipes, etc) and you can't buy hand sanitizer. Otherwise, TP is in stock most places, Chicken is stocked back up, pasta and canned soups are stocked back up, etc. --- So i was wondering, cuz I live in a "big" city, how the boonies do with this covid/SocDist situation? All the info i get is from my parents who live in a 30k person town with 1 grocery story. But, as with most "country folk" stereotypes, is the social distancing thing happening as feverishly in these small towns as it is in the big cities? If anyone lives in one, maybe they can comment. Like, to give a city slicker perspective, i went for a walk today down town and passed probably 100 people. Every last one of them went off-sidewalk, as did I, and we kept at least 10 feet. It was pretty intriguing and surreal actually. I'm just not sure this happens in the small towns, where people generally know one another more, or have more of a "connection" with unknowns....are they keeping a distance?
">there's no amount of benefit to hospital workers that can justify the active policy of lying to the public about the benefit of masks. 

Yes there is.  Itâ€™s called saving as many sick people as possible.  They need the PPE to protect themselves so that they can treat as many patients as possible in the coming months(this includes Covid-19 positives as well as any other patient that ends up in a hospital). Joe six pack can protect himself by practicing social distancing, proper hand washing, daily disinfecting and sanitizing of his work area, and minimizing actual human to human contact as much as possible.  So we shouldnâ€™t be wasting any PPE on him

We already know joe six pack will make a run on anything that he knows will protect him(see TP hand sanitizer, Lysol, and n95 mask shortages). We already know people will steal the shit if given the opportunity.  He will take it and use it for himself *at the expense of the people that actually need it* either for personal monetary gain or to protect himself above anyone else.  If the government were to be honest this is what is happening and will continue to happen.  

If misleading the public distracts joe six pack long enough to properly restock hospitals and state stockpiles it would save more lives because *if* joe six pack does catch it from frying chicken he will be able to go to that hospital and be treated by a non infected staff.  If he takes those valuable resources from hospital staff he will probably still catch the disease because he doesnâ€™t know how to do a proper fit test.  Only now heâ€™s joe sick pack with the disease and the hospital staff is infected so they both die.

>Or you know, the fake ""essential"" work could be canceled. But then the hospital workers wouldn't be getting their fried chicken

Iâ€™m sure they would happily make that trade if it meant they were guaranteed the necessary PPE.  If they arenâ€™t well enough to take care of the sick and injured then weâ€™re all fucked anyways."
Day 8 or 9. Some rattling in upper bronchial area. Dryish cough. Never developed the fever reported but that's probably because I worked for 16 hours outside two days in a row at onset of sickness. Sweated greatly. Constant intake of fluids, water. Eating citrus and fruits. Had dizzy spells, Light headed. Numbness of face and lips. Also tongue but just the tip and a few inches back. Later in evening early onset photo phobic reactions and sparks in eyes. Like sudden onset of cataracts or a flashbulb flashed in eyes. Compromised vision. Duration one hour two occasions. Smells and tastes. Comes and goes. Smell steak being cooked. Have sad there is no steak. Smell shit. Is no shit. Smell farts. Did you know small birds have huge farts? Spray Lysol. Takes a few minutes to be able to smell it's fragrance. Later have acute sense of smell. Smell stuff across room correctly. Notice florals in perfume and other earthy ingredients never noticed before in cologne. Ear right side hurting. Sweat at night prior to intense need to urinate. Kidneys and lower back hurting. Ear ache probably due to moisture and captured heat. Ear ache goes away. Normal tinnitus in right ear less severe. Left ear still same. Kidneys still hurt. Strong smell of coffee. Burning in urethra prior, during and after urination, possible urethritis. Drink nothing by but water with some cranberry juice thrown in. Burning stops. Cough remind but come and goes. Had runny nose. Then later dry sinus. Irritated in back of throat near connection to throat, uvula area. Taste peanut butter. I like peanut butter. I sleep walk and eat peanut butter. Now that's all I taste. Urine smells like peanut butter. Best return to salads and fruits veggies. Cough slightly more productive. Irritation levels elevated. Still no fever. Possible insomnia and nausea but normal daily occurrence prior to illness attributed to change in diet and type of food consumed. Not dead yet. Might just be a cold. Self quarantined. Would refuse vaccine. I just don't trust any of them any more.

[QUOTE="raceadodge, post: 72121802, member: 50532"] Below is what a police officer has said about what is going on in our country now. I donâ€™t want any comments on this, Iâ€™m just posting. NOW WHAT THE COP SAID: I try not to live under a rock, letâ€™s be real. Iâ€™m a cop and see things that arenâ€™t reported in media. However, I also try my best to pay attention to my surroundings and with that being said. Our Government is under attack from within. If you donâ€™t believe so, then you probably also believe that this is the first time the Corona virus has been identified. Think about whatâ€™s transpired over the last few months. The government has presented every possible demographic including a self proclaimed socialist as a democratic candidate because they fear something they canâ€™t control. The impeachment hoax failed and immediately Pelosi vowed to exhaust efforts in overthrowing Trump. If you currently can see this post then until last week you were living in the most thriving economy this nation has ever seen in my lifetime. Only due to the fact that the person in control couldnâ€™t be bought. If you think for one second this â€œpandemicâ€ is not media driven, and controlled by the radical people in powerful places....well...go back to sleep under the rock you crawled out from. Oh, and go ahead at this point and click on my name and follow the steps to unfriend or unfollow me as well because you really arenâ€™t going to like this. This thing has killed less people in the same time frame then cigarettes, cancer, drunk driving, domestic violence, car crashes, cross stitching accidents (j/k on the last one but probably close), stabbings, overdoses, and please donâ€™t get me started on abortion. Wake up!!! This is what the beginning of socialism looks like! They are controlling what you buy...bc itâ€™s what you think you need, where you go...bc itâ€™s where they tell you not to go, and how to live...bc you now fear the very existence of anything outside of your home and control. They are leading with fear. Causing you to panic like sheep. They are crashing the stock market to run on a failing economy, because itâ€™s all they have left. What is this saying to all of the countries that have opposed us for decades but, couldnâ€™t defeat us? Itâ€™s saying...biological war fare will make these idiots glued to CNN and every other liberal news source panic and run for the hills. You donâ€™t need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns! Now wash your hands and live the life they donâ€™t want you to have! [/QUOTE] Straight up whatâ€™s actually happening.
Need help getting this message to the right people. I'm hoping this memo gets to your team.. Supplies are being hoarded by government and their agencies. Here in Queens, NY and in Manhattan, FRONTLINERS AND PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GO WORK AT CRITICAL/ESSENTIAL STORES (LIKE PHARMACIES, SUPERMARKETS, FOOD SERVICE, ETC,) AND THOSE WHO NEED TO GO OUT SHOPPING... CANNOT FIND N95 MASKS, LYSOL, PURELL OR ALTERNATIVES. This is putting them, their families and everyone they come in contact with, in danger and helping spread the the virus. Especially in our Hotspot City. MEMO: NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM SAY, WE ARE NOT REALISTICALLY GETTING THESE SUPPLIES, I ALSO HEAR FROM FRONTLINERS THAT THEY ALSO ARE NOT GETTING THESE SUPPLIES, REGARDLESS. LIMITED SELLING, AND ANTI: HOARDING/RESELLING MEASURES NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND ENFORCED. NOW!!!!! DOCTORS AND CLINICS ARE NOT OFFERING CORONA VIRUS TESTING, NOR ARE PRESCRIBING THE MALARIA DRUG COMBO TO THOSE WHO HAVE CLEAR SYMPTOMS AND COME INTO THE ER. VERBATIM. ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CRITICAL GET ADMITTED TO HOSPITALS AND GET TESTED. THE DOCTORS STILL SAY "THE DRUG COMBO IS NOT PROVEN TO WORK" AND THEY THEREFORE "DONT PRESCRIBE IT OR ADMINISTER IT". EVEN IF YOU ARE AN ADMITTED PATIENT. This is why people are dropping like flies in the NYC area. ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE JUST DIED WITHIN 24 HOURS. THIS IS MAKING 9/11 LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK!!!!! I legally recorded calls with doctors, clinics and ER staff. This is fact! THEY ARE NOT TREATING PATIENTS WITH THE COMBO DRUG YOU SUGGESTED. NOR ARE THEY PRESCRIBING IT TO PREVENT VULNERABLE PATIENTS FROM GETTING TO A DIRE STAGE AND WHERE DEATH IS IMMINENT!!! People need immediate supplies to stop this ever-growing spread. They only consider prescribing it when it's TOO LATE and out of panic when they speculate the patient is likely to die within hours. At that point their organs are destroyed and there is no possibility of recovery! WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THESE STUBBORN RETARDED DOCTORS TO ADMINISTER/PRESCRIBE THIS DRUG COMBO AND TEST PEOPLE, SO THAT THEY KNOW, DON'T GO OUT INFECTING OTHERS, AND INSTEAD TAKE PRECAUTIONS, ISOLATE THEMSELVES AND GET EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. These doctors are playing God and causing people to die by not providing these tests or treatments. There are too many chefs in the kitchen! And many are apparantly God Complex Narcasists with O.D.D. (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). ON A SIDE NOTE: STORES ARE NOT GETTING THESE SUPPLIES AND AMAZON IS NOT SELLING NEEDED SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO DONT WORK IN HOSPITALS OR DOCTORS OFFICES...; But need these supplies! This is causing the virus to spread and replicate. We need to stop its spread, not just at hospitals. Hospital staff are careful and have better access to supplies and protection; but the public are not that conscious/carefull and don't have any access. They need it most! We don't need more Fire Men/Engines; we need to stop the raging forest fire from spreading!!! WE ALL NEED ACCESS TO THESE SUPPLIES! ESPECIALLY IN HOT SPOTS. PLEASE HELP RECTIFY THIS IMMEDIATELY!
Get real! Not everyone makes alot of money, has a car and a Costco membership. And even if they did, stores are sold out! Therefore pople go out every onther day, hoping that product becomes available. Others are still waiting for financial assistance as they cant go and work all this time. Others work in essential stores sych as pharmacies and supermarkets where they nees to engage with shoppers. Those people have no access to any masks, lysol or PURELL!

Ariana Grande I want people to take this seriously." ForDr. Contessa Metcalfeand her husbandDr. Scott Metcalfe, they can't help but feel a little uneasy about what's to come. "I am absolutely working longer hours and so is my husband and we put ourselves in harm's way every single day we are at work," Dr. Contessa shared. "I don't think, with exception of when we were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan while I was in the Navy, I've seen health care workers as fearful as our patients since at any moment a doctor can become a patient." Get more perspective on the Coronavirus from Bravo'sMarried to Medicinecast below. Instagram Dr. Heavenly Kimes and Dr. Damon Kimes While Dr. Heavenly has had to close her office for any non-emergency procedures, the celebrity dentist still sees post-operative patients needing follow ups as well as emergency cases like tooth absences. As for her husband, Dr. Damon is thankful to have a business that does not have to close. "We have ramped up our personal protective measures and we spend almost double the time cleaning and sanitizing the office," Dr. Heavenly explained to us. "Our patients are thankful we have changed measures to meet their needs." The couple urges Americans to stay home. And while the hospitals absolutely need supplies, there is also a need for all workers including Dr. Damon who specializes in pain, family addiction and emergency medicine. "We want Americans to know the front line extends past hospitals. Of course the emergency departments and intensive care units deserve the most support but N95 masks are needed for all health care workers," Dr. Heavenly shared. "We need the protection. If you have unopened N95 masks or the equivalent, please donate to your local hospital and medical offices."

"Scott and I have been asked to put medicine first and I felt really guilty about not keeping up with our kids' school work," Dr. Contessa shared with us. "[Parents are] going to have to cut ourselves some slackâ€¦Please be reassured that home is the best place for them right now." According to Dr. Contessa, the pandemic has made her even more passionate about public health and becoming a surgeon general one day. "I'm honored to be a doctor and to have the opportunity to take care of patients during this crisis," she explained. "I commendDr. Jerome AdamsandDr. Anthony Faucifor their medical leadership." At the same time, the Bravo star believes the data we were given was "inaccurate" leaving some to be completely misinformed and unprepared for the crisis. "We were told before this started that young people were relatively spared. However, this virus affects everyone," Dr. Contessa explained. "We really need to take these precautions seriously especially in regards to isolation because we have seen people in their 20s and 30s on ventilators and even dying due to COVID-19." Dr. Eugene Harris and Toya Bush-Harris Like many doctors, Dr. Eugene has a new routine for leaving the hospital and returning home. "I now have to take my clothes off in the garage and Lysol my bags before entering home," he shared with E! News. "We've never washed our hands quite this much." Dr. Eugene and Toya want to "normalize" their children's daily lives so that they are not "living in fear." "This has been a very trying time. We've taken on the role of elementary school teachers while trying to entertain Ashton and Avery from day to day," he explained. "On a brighter note, we have played so many family games, learned a lot about our children's needs when it comes to certain subjects in school and have great meals together. These memories are priceless and gives us more to look back on in the future." And as hospitals continue to have daily meetings and updates from the CDC on best practices, Dr. Eugene has a message of hope during the chaos. "I believe that Americans are learning to be nicer to each other and families are growing closer so if there's a silver lining, I believe it's that."
Everyone okay? I mean, really. Things okay? I'm fine so far, if you call wandering around the house several times a day with a Lysol wipe in my hand "fine." I swear to God, the smell of Lysol wipes will always remind me of this weird spring. Anyone else here shocked at the number of items your family touches with their hands during the course of a day? Just me? Never mind then. Spring continues apaceI still have a job, and it's telework anyway, so my life is a weird combination of normal and oh, so NOT normal right now. It's a little hard to get work done with all these people home all day, plus my efficiency is definitely impaired by my compulsive need to reload the Johns Hopkins coronavirus map every 15 minutes or so. A neighbor and I set up a neighborhood Facebook group so sick or elderly neighbors could ask for help shopping or just anyone could ask for a single item without having to make an extra trip to the store. I know! I'm practically the Mother Teresa of the COVID-19 era, right? But it was the only thing I could think of to do about any of this. And it seems akin to holding up a fan to try to blow away a tornado. I've developed a little ritual of shoving a piece of still-warm homemade bread slathered with butter into my mouth once a day. It just feels like the right thing to do. We're baking an awful lot of breadAnna's here! She had been hunkered down in Tunisia for about two weeks, teleworking from her cute little apartment, but suddenly the Embassy offered repatriation flights with a now-or-never warning, and she decided she couldn't go 3 or 4 (or 5!) months without talking to someone, anyone, in person. She might be regretting that decision at this point, I don't know. It's hard to be an independent adult and suddenly find yourself living in your parents' basement. She's handling it pretty well, though, I'll give her that. Theo is teleworking and isolating in his own apartment. But first he spent two weeks teaching people at his office how to use their laptops to telework from their homes, which means he was in close physical contact with well over 200 people just as we started being told to STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE. So we told him we'd see him at Easter. Maybe. It feels odd telling your own (grown) kid to stay away. This all still seems like a weird dream, doesn't it? Also, he's apparently got the patience of a saint. These people he was helping were all my age or older and very confused about the teleworking thing. One guy took his laptop home and didn't understand why it didn't work the way it did at the office. It didn't work at all, actually. Because he didn't know he had to connect it to a wifi network in his house. There were a lot of stories like that, and I loved them all, because these people made me look like an honest-to-goodness tech genius by comparison. Cooking a lot of dinner, too I've made 3 batches of chicken soup. I figure we need to have it on hand in case anyone gets sick, because that will be the cure. Humor me, okay? But no one we know around here is sick yet, so there's this eerie feeling of waiting that reminds me of when I was 4 years old and my friend and I ate the ENTIRE bottle of chewable vitamins, so her mother (after she recovered from the near heart attack we had just given her) dumped ipecac down both our throats and sat us on the edge of the tub, where we waited to throw up. It feels like that. We've gone biking to our favorite sandwich shop and bought sandwiches there, even if people did breathe on them as they put them together. We decided (maybe stupidly) that it was worth the risk. I mean, they are REALLY GOOD sandwiches. We walk miles every day, because we have to get out of the house and we definitely need exercise. To counteract that daily homemade bread and butter... 3 weeks ago, I thought I would go nuts not being able to go anywhere or see any of my friends, but it turns out I really don't care. It's just not fun going out anymore. Inside the house, I can pretend things are sort of normal. I mean, except for that Lysol wipes thing... Going out, though, it really hits you - NOT normal. The masks (yes, I have one), the 6-foot distance rule, the uneasiness at the grocery store. It just feels better to stay home and chew on slabs of buttered, yeasty goodness, you know? I feel guilty making jokes right now, because this virus is affecting people I know, as is probably true for anyone reading this. My friend's father-in-law is dying alone in NY right now, his wife unable to be with him, her siblings, children, and grandchildren unable to go comfort her. This all feels like an ugly, slow-motion roll of horror that you know is heading toward everyone you know, and in the meantime you can almost feel the pain reverberating in the air, much like in the days after 9/11. And the only way to stay somewhat sane is to keep living your life as if everything is normal (plus, uh, those Lysol wipes), even though it's most emphatically NOT normal. Not at all. Hence, homemade bread. Chicken soup. A few tepid jokes. That's all I've got right now, and it really isn't enough. It's all just a little tiny fan trying to blow away that tornado. I'm sorry.
Most New Yorkers have to go shopping outside their home for food and groceries during the novel coronavirus pandemic, taking the chance of contaminating themselves, their families and their apartments. The National Institute of Health says coronavirus can live on cardboard for an hour, and on plastic or metal surfaces for three days, so care needs to be taken to disinfect groceries and takeout. Some Brooklyn residents have shared with us their methods for disinfecting their groceries and food deliveries. Visit the CDC website ( cdc.gov ) first, then check out these tips from your neighbors: DAILY TOP BROOKLYN NEWS News for those who live, work and play in Brooklyn and beyond Leave this field empty if you're human: Donâ€™t forget the dog Kate Chura, executive director of the Montague Street BID, says sheâ€™s always left her shoes outside her apartment. To that she has now added the packaging from her shopping. â€œI wipe down everything before it crosses the threshold,â€ she said. â€œWipes and a box cutter are on my welcome mat. Even my dog Wiley gets [an] all-four-paw-cleaning after a walk.â€ One-glove method Brooklyn Heights resident Beverly Closs has developed an ingenious â€œone-gloveâ€ system for shopping without actually touching any groceries. â€œI go to Peas and Pickles [aka All In One Market, on Pineapple Walk] at midnight. There is usually one person shopping and four cops hanging around inside. I wear a mask and only one glove,â€ she said. â€œMy gloved hand picks the groceries. My ungloved hand is in my pocket, always, holding my keys and the money. I bring my own plastic bag and tell the cashier to throw the change in the bag. When I get to my apartment, I leave the bag outside the apartment door, use my gloved hand to take out the groceries and change. I wash the items, throw out the bag and wash my hands.â€ She explained why she just wears one glove. â€œMy theory is that if you put your gloved hand in your pocket, you are contaminating your pocket and keys. I also donâ€™t bring my phone to minimize contamination. Also, the ungloved hand can unzip my jacket without contamination,â€ Closs said. Leave it for three days Cobble Hill resident Lynn Gordon has also put a lot of thought into her disinfection method. â€œFirst of all, any item that isnâ€™t perishable stays in the bag for up to three days. Same for packages delivered. I leave them downstairs after accepting them, go upstairs and wash my hands, and donâ€™t touch them again for three days,â€ she told the Eagle. â€œMail, too.â€ â€œFor perishables, I wipe them down with sanitizing wipes. The wipes actually expired a few months ago so even though theyâ€™re still wet they might not as potent. So I boost their sanitizing power by adding a little bit of the worst smelling â€˜wintergreenâ€™ isopropyl alcohol,â€ Gordon said. (The wintergreen variety was all that was available.) â€œAnything that wouldnâ€™t do well with alcohol on it but can withstand plain old soap and water (apples, lemons, potatoes) gets washed with that.â€ Cut back to once a week Councilmember Stephen Levin told the Brooklyn Eagle that his family shops for groceries only about about once a week to limit exposure. â€œAnd yes, weâ€™ve been using Clorox hydrogen peroxide wipes to wipe them down,â€ he added. Disinfect doorknobs and light switches Lara Birnback, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, says she has started wearing gloves when going shopping, and may be making a homemade mask if she canâ€™t find an official one. Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers on Thursday to begin wearing a face covering like a scarf or a bandana when they leave their homes. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the White House is said to be considering advising all Americans to start wearing masks or some sort of ad hoc facial covering. â€œI havenâ€™t been truly sanitizing anything from the store but washing my hands carefully many many times a day,â€ she said. She said she tries to wipe down her phone â€œa lotâ€ and Lysols her doorknobs and other areas. â€œIâ€™ve been coming to the office in the mornings but touching nothing in the public spaces and wiping all the knobs and light switches, even though Iâ€™m the only one in the office,â€ she said.â€ When shopping for seniors Will Hasty, a Brooklyn Heights resident, is shopping for his parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hasty is following recommendations he got from cousins and family friends who are doctors, he told the Eagle. He keeps an extra set of clothes in his houseâ€™s front vestibule. â€œI treat it like an airlock,â€ he said. When he gets back from shopping, â€œI disrobe, drop the outside clothes into a container and take it to the washing machine.â€ Hasty uses sterile wipes to disinfect the shopping bagsâ€™ handles before he brings them inside. â€œInside the house, I wipe every container and put the groceries in a separate, sterile bag to give to my older parents,â€ he said. He leaves the newly filled bags in the elevator bank in his parentsâ€™ building. â€œIâ€™m in quarantine. They pick them up.â€ Hasty wears a mask and gloves as well, he said. Since masks are scarce, he cleans and reuses his. To clean the mask, he sprays it with Lysol and puts it in a plastic bag for awhile. Imagine your groceries are covered with glitter Councilmember Laurie Cumbo has shared a YouTube video put together by Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen, a family medicine specialist in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Dr. VanWingen says to imagine your groceries are covered with glitter, and your goal is to not get glitter all over your house, on your hands or especially on your face. Disinfectants and soap have the power to dissolve that glitter. His tips include: â€“ Wipe down your shopping cart â€“ Commit to buying an item before you pick it up. â€“ Donâ€™t go shopping if you are sick or have been exposed. â€“ Get two weeks worth of groceries at a time. â€“ Before you go out shopping, sanitize your table or counter and mark off half where you will put the â€œdirtyâ€ items and half where you will only place disinfected items. Dr. VanWingen throws out unnecessary cardboard packaging, like cereal boxes. He washes fruit for 20 seconds in soapy water, and he lets it soak a bit for good measure. For takeout food, â€œBe more concerned about the wrappers than the food,â€ he sad. Unwrap the food and dump it on the plate without letting it touch the outside of the wrapper. Heat destabilizes some forms of coronavirus, so choose hot takeout foods over cold foods, and go ahead and reheat them in the microwave. Some coronaviruses can survive frozen up to two years, so scrub down the outside of the ice cream container before you put it in the freezer. SHARE ARTICLE: Leave a Comment
Ingrid De La Mare Kenny was vacationing in the French Alps in early March when cities throughout Italy began to shut down, alarmed by the climbing dying toll from the new coronavirus. On Instagram, where De La Mare Kenny has about 55,000 followers, she posed with oysters and champagne, her mirrored sun shades reflecting the mountain snow. Certainly, she experienced gone skiing in the midst of the coronavirus, she explained to her followers in the caption, and she was ready to accept it. â€œI cannot retain putting up about health and fitness and flat tummies and dismiss the pink elephant in the home. Corona virus is not a gimmick, it's occurring, and you want to be educated about your immune method to stay away from slipping victim to it,â€ she wrote. Then she recommended that her followers consider Just Inulin, a dietary dietary supplement she sells on her site for â‚¬26.99. De La Mare Kenny has all the trappings of a specified type of wellness influencer: her personal Pilates-impressed training routine, her own line of holistic solutions, and a strong social media existence to promote it all. With this system, she's acquired a moderate Instagram subsequent. Other women, and guys, have turned their nutritious lifestyles into platforms that arrive at thousands and thousands. It's a environment of by no means-ending detoxes, athleisure couture, and #fitspo with a side of system-maximizing nutritional supplements. Some of the goods are so ubiquitous that they've come to be a punchline: Did you listen to the just one about the movie star with the flat-tummy tea? Simply just Inulin is a powder, not a tea, but its webpage continue to promises a â€œflatter tummy rapidly.â€ On Instagram, it is now been repurposed as a answer to Covid-19. â€œThe immune process is in just us, we just can't purchase it, but we sure can strengthen it and make it bullet proof to Corona,â€ De La Mare Kenny wrote in a article. â€œSimply Inulin is the pretty weapon to improve your immune technique and combat off Corona Virus. It's science and it will combat it off significantly much better than a mask can.â€ Apart from it's not science. The US Meals and Drug Administration recognizes inulin as a nutritional fiber, but that's it. Any assert that inulin could â€œfight offâ€ the virus? â€œWe don't have any evidence for that,â€ claims Walter Willett, a diet scientist at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of General public Wellness. And it isn't just inulin. Close to the website, staples of the wellness sceneâ€”vitamin gummies, CBD tinctures, diet tablets, turmericâ€”are receiving described with renewed urgency â€œduring these timesâ€ (hashtag coronavirus). There are at the moment no vaccines or medicines with Fda acceptance to avoid or treatment Covid-19. Researchers are investigating vaccines and treatments, but even promising candidates however require to endure scientific tests, which can take a when. In the meantime, authorities like the Entire world Overall health Business endorse actions like social distancing and hand washing. Examine all of our coronavirus protection listed here. Plenty of wellness influencers are following the WHO's guide, offering quiet and comforting content material about remaining nutritious even though keeping at household. But some have used their platforms to force statements about Covid-19 that absence scientific support and merchandise that could be potentially unsafe. Krystal Nielsonâ€”a previous Bachelor contestant turned health mentor with over 600,000 followers on Instagramâ€”posted a video quite a few weeks ago reciting an unsubstantiated assert about the back links amongst processed foods, irritation, and Covid-19. Then she plugged her system detox application, which can charge concerning $97 and $494. The online video, which was included at the time by stores like Buzzfeed, has considering the fact that been deleted. Extra recently, Ben Greenfield, a former bodybuilder with an Instagram next of virtually 250,000, posted about ozone treatment, an different medicine he promises is â€œproven to kill the SARS coronavirusâ€ and â€œcould also operate on the new virus.â€ Greenfield's article incorporated a connection to buy a $6,000 at-residence ozone generatorâ€”with code BEN100 for a $100 discount. â€œI bought their Quantum 5 Ozone Generator, and have been undertaking each day rectal ozone insufflation for myself and my household with it,â€ Greenfield wrote. â€œThese are disappearing as persons come across out about how powerful they are for viruses and for strengthening the immune technique so I experienced to get this publish out quickly. They will likely be marketed out by the conclude of this week.â€ Ozone, a molecular sort of oxygen, can be made use of as a disinfectant. But â€œthe idea of working with a disinfectant internally is a flawed just one,â€ says Michael Starnbach, whose lab at Harvard focuses on microbiology and immunobiology. It's about as sensible as a Lysol enema, and potentially perilous. In an interview, Greenfield said he bought his ozone generator at the encouragement of a functional drugs physician, a style of alternate health and fitness follow. â€œI recognize this is anecdotal, but a lot of of the useful medication docs I discuss to are using ozone and I'm pretty compelled as far as what I have witnessed,â€ he mentioned. But Food and drug administration polices alert that â€œozone is a toxic gasoline with no known beneficial health care application in precise, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. In order for ozone to be productive as a germicide, it have to be current in a concentration much larger than that which can be properly tolerated by gentleman and animals.â€ Greenfield stands by his publish about ozone therapy and says he tries to offer his following with as substantially of the research as attainable. â€œI'm rather careful with what I adhere up my ass,â€ he claims. Posts like Greenfield's are significantly less widespread than these with claims, like De La Mare Kenny's, about â€œboosting immunityâ€ in buy to secure in opposition to the coronavirus. De La Mare Kenny declined to be interviewed for this piece, but wrote in an e mail that â€œinulin is really beneficial to the immune system.â€ A large amount of factors are beneficial to the immune process, in accordance to influencers. In a video clip identified as â€œHow to develop immunity for the CORONAVIRUS,â€ the YouTuber Holly Dolke suggests a variety of nutritional vitamins and dietary supplements that she believes will â€œhelp prevent the infection.â€ Amid them: vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc. Sergi Constance, a Spanish bodybuilder with much more than 4 million followers on Instagram, has spent the past 7 days recommending his company's most recent product or service, Immune Sophisticated, to â€œhelp avoid virus infection.â€ One particular post's graphic shows bottles of the health supplement surrounded by the now infamous spiky coronavirus alone, as if to generate the stage dwelling. Scientific tests do recommend that obtaining adequate diet can make improvements to the body's capacity to combat off infections sufficient amounts of vitamin D, for example, have been connected to a modest reduction in infections like the popular chilly. But that does not signify using hundreds of vitamin D, or any other supplement, can prevent a viral ailment. â€œThere is no facts on how we boost our immunity with dietary supplements or diet, exclusively for Covid-19,â€ Willett suggests. Section of what will make this novel coronavirus so dangerous is that it's model new, and researchers are nevertheless striving to have an understanding of how it spreads. Men and women with weakened immune devices may be at increased danger for intense difficulties of the disease, in accordance to the CDC, but even anyone in excellent overall health can still get contaminated with the virus.
The coronavirus has Americans, including Virginians, scared. They should be frightened. But thrumming in the background just below our fear of this new and deadly disease is an additional layer of anxiety caused by shortages of vital supplies we used to take for granted a month ago. Just at a time when we are being urged to social distance and stay at home, many of us are having trouble finding groceries. Older, more vulnerable people who want to opt for delivery services are finding it impossible to set up delivery dates. The lucky ones manage to snag a date a month away at best. And then they canâ€™t be assured they will get things they need. People going to stores are regularly confronted with empty shelves, especially for staples like bread, eggs, milk, toilet paper, and disinfectants. Because of that, people take what they can find and are forced to go out shopping more times in the week than they want, shop at multiple stores on a trip, and expose themselves more than they wish to the risk of Covid-19. Even when we want to shelter in place, we are forced out to forage for essentials. At first I chalked this up to a surge of panic buying. People were stocking up in anticipation of shortages, and for the very valid reason that they wanted a two to three week (maybe a month) supply of groceries precisely because they wanted to limit their trips to stores. Up to a point, the reasons seemed valid. And I expected that once people had their supply, theyâ€™d hunker down and stores would be restocked. That hasnâ€™t happened. I havenâ€™t seen toilet paper in a store in three weeks. It shows up periodically, very early in the morning, a few days a week, and promptly disappears. The panic buying and hoarding continue. The same for disinfectants. Iâ€™ve managed to buy plenty of food, including fresh meats and vegetables. My husband and I have found bread, if not always exactly the brand we wanted. And weâ€™ve gotten milk and after a couple of times not finding it, even eggs. But not toilet paper, which Iâ€™ve snagged online a couple of times. Disinfectant wipes, however, have been impossible to find, whether in stores or online. Even Walmart, Target, and CVS have not been delivering it and only occasionally have it in the stores near me. At some point I began to wonder what was really going on. After three to four weeks of sustained shortages, I asked what was really wrong with our supply chain? Has it truly broken? The answer is complicated. And I will start with the good news. For toilet paper, actually no. It, and other paper goods like dinner napkins, paper towels, and tissues are actually made in the U.S. The shortages do seem to be caused by unrelenting buying and hoarding. The companies would like you and me to stop doing that. At the same time, they are reluctant to ramp up supplies because they are afraid that once the virus subsides and things go back to normal â€“ hopefully, by summer â€“ they will be facing an oversupply of their products. The logic goes that all those hoarders will have a basement full of unused paper products and stores wonâ€™t even be able to give it away. That could be true later on. But people respond to immediate cues. As long as they continue to see empty shelves and experience difficulties now, they wonâ€™t change their hoarding behavior anyway. So, if those companies want us to stop, as they say they do, they probably do need to temporarily step up production. Once people are no longer experiencing shortages, they will stop hoarding and not until then. But for other vital goods, the solution is not so simple. Too many of our favorite products actually are produced overseas, where we compete on an international market with every other country facing the same crisis as us, including the same panic and hoarding. We really canâ€™t get Lysol wipes because they arenâ€™t available, or they are only available in very limited quantities. The problem is almost all the chemicals used in disinfectant are made overseas, and most of the governments in countries where they are made have limited their export. According to the Consumer Brands Association, in a letter they released to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the U.S. Trade Representative: â€œARLINGTON, Va. â€” The Consumer Brands Association today called on U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to work on behalf of American consumers by combating global export restrictions on the materials needed to treat and prevent coronavirus. Additionally, the association asked for further protections against international hoarding of materials required to make products that maintain the health and well-being of American consumers. â€œ â€˜We are facing an unprecedented global crisis and cooperation must trump isolation,â€™ said Bryan Zumwalt, executive vice president of public affairs for Consumer Brands. â€˜Trade relationships are critical to slowing this pandemic, yet multiple countries are responding by restricting exports of chemicals, ingredients and final products â€” action that will only exacerbate the risk of product shortages at a time they are needed most.â€™ â€œCountries including India, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Russia have all enacted export restrictions on various chemicals, base ingredients and protective medical products in response to the coronavirus, disrupting the global supply chain and exacerbating shortages of already high-demand products.â€ And those are the shortages in production for simple household goods that you and I canâ€™t get. The situation gets far more dire. Anybody reading a newspaper or watching news knows our hospitals and medical personnel are facing an unprecedented shortage of protective personal equipment (PPE), including face masks, gloves, and hospital gowns. And ventilators. All of that equipment is made overseas. One reason given for the shortages is that the U.S. has to compete on a global market. Free markets and the global competition doing what they are supposed to, right? To an extent, thatâ€™s true. As the Washington Post reported: â€œSeveral reports in recent days have documented a Wild West-style online marketplace for bulk medical supplies dominated by intermediaries and hoarders who are selling N95 respirator masks and other gear at huge markups.Â Forbes reportedÂ that U.S. vendors have sold 280Â million masks â€” mostly into the export market â€” and that U.S. states and local governments were outbid in the frenzy.Â The Washington PostÂ andÂ ReutersÂ have reported this week on the stockpileâ€™s dwindling supplies. â€œThere are few signs the Trump administration is making efforts to stop the export shipments or seize the supplies for use in U.S. hospitals, despite statements from Attorney General William P. Barr last week that U.S. wholesalers hoarding masks and other supplies would get â€œa knock on your door.â€ Ah, but if only simple greed and an open market were the issues, it might be solvable. But two other things have collided to worsen the situation. First, the U.S. has actually been exporting and selling our supply to countries overseas. And the main producer of those now scarce goods, China, began limiting supplies when the coronavirus first struck them. According to the New York Times: â€œSHANGHAI â€” As hospitals and governmentsÂ hunt desperately for respirators and surgical masksÂ to protect doctors and nurses from the coronavirus pandemic, they face a difficult reality: The world depends on China to make them, and the country is only beginning to share. â€œChina made half the worldâ€™s masks before the coronavirus emerged there, and it has expanded production nearly 12-fold since then. But it has claimed mask factory output for itself. Purchases and donations also brought ChinaÂ a big chunk of the worldâ€™s supply from elsewhere. â€œNow, worries about mask supplies are rising. As the virusâ€™s global spread escalates, governments around the world are restricting exports of protective gear, which experts say could worsen the pandemic.â€ And this, from the same Times article: â€œPeter Navarro, an adviser to President Trump on manufacturing and trade, contended on Fox Business last month that China had essentially taken over factories that make masks on behalf of American companies. Beijing, he said, had opted to â€œnationalize effectively 3M, our company.â€ One reason is that over the last two decades China has become the primary manufacturer for the worldâ€™s masks and respirators. When the virus swept through China in late 2019 and early 2020, the countryâ€™s increased need for masks dealt a double whammy to the global supply. The US is particularly reliant on China for masks and other medical gear.Â According toÂ the Department of Health and Human Services, 95 percent of surgical masks and 70 percent of respirators used in the US are made overseas, and China is one of the biggest producers.â€ Basically, Americans are generous people. But we have been giving away the store to countries that are not only not reciprocating in our time of great need, but have been pulling up their moats when it comes to the supply chain. Maybe itâ€™s human nature, and even prudent, to put your own people first. But thatâ€™s faint comfort to the nurses, doctors, EMTs, and other healthcare professionals on the frontlines without protective equipment. Itâ€™s no comfort at all to families who will lose loved ones because every state and the federal government is facing a severe shortage of ventilators. And it is a cruel lack of comfort to ordinary Americans searching frantically for a container of disinfectant at a store to keep their family safe at home. Our supply chain is broken. One cause is that we make so little at home. While it is noble and inspiring that an army of volunteers has begun sewing homemade face masks for hospitals, it is appalling that a country as rich and powerful as ours has been reduced to this. Even more concerning though is the vulnerability it is showing the world. Any country is only as secure as its supply chain. Once our enemies know â€“ and they are watching â€“ how fragile that is, we become weaker still on an international stage. Three things in our current policy have weakened us: isolation from our allies, tariffs that have made raw materials more expensive, and lack of manufacturing capacity. We need to trade with the world for certain. But we need to bring production back home too. We need to make things here or all the laws giving presidents emergency powers to order factories to produce necessities wonâ€™t matter. Without domestic manufacturing, presidential authority becomes a moot point. After this crisis, our country is going to need a serious discussion of our weaknesses, not the least of which is how to incentivize our multinational companies to come home. It canâ€™t be done by fiat in a free country. But the government can create an industrial policy that makes domestic manufacturing more attractive. That can include tax breaks for opening new factories and tax penalties for those who make excessive profits from overseas production. There is a mix of tools that can be used. But America must never be caught so short again by a national emergency. Karen Duncan used to blog at Anonymous Is A Woman from 2005 until 2010.

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stops to talk with a little girl at LAâ€™s Nickerson Gardens public housing in Watts in 1964. The Watts Rebellion broke out in 1965. And Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. We remember McCoy Tyner, pianist and wonderful soul, Bill Withers and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We also remember Madam CJ Walker â€“ donâ€™t miss the Netflix Seriess I say Maafa â€“ Covid-19 because if we arenâ€™t careful we are going to allow this virus to take too many of our people either physically, emotionally or psychologically. Our elders are being denied visits with family as they are confined to their rooms. The sick are also isolated â€“ no visitors. In hospice families are not allowed access to their loved ones as in the past â€“ one canâ€™t spend the night or visit whenever one likes. Sister Sadie Williamsâ€™s son Dan died in late March and she hadnâ€™t been able to visit him because of Covid-19. His children did, but not his mom. California Coalition for Women Prisoners is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and many of the women I met when I was going in visiting are free now â€“ some released in time to die. However, there are many women who are still inside. Convicted as children, these women are not eligible for the legislation over the past decade that guaranteed juvenile offenders parole dates. Supposedly, there are no juveniles serving life sentences, yet that is not true. Women who are in their 30s now were convicted as children, some as young as 14 or 15. Life without Possibility of Parole or LWOP means even if you are dying, you will not get out. At Central California Womenâ€™s Facility in the Central Valley, Chowchilla, where the water is polluted and no one who can afford to buy their water drinks it, the air is not much better. A nurse came down with the virus and all the other staff who came in contact with her were self-quarantined along with one prisoner. Yet, how do incarcerated people quarantine in a crowded facility? Sponsored by Revcontent 48,665 Friday, March 27, a day Californians and New Yorkers petitioned legislators to release people locked behind bars, Gov. Newsom signed to parole 27 prisoners. These parole requests were from January-December 2019, quite a few persons incarcerated as youth for 30-40 years. Most were men, none released for humanitarian reasons like those prisoners who are dying with not much time to live. Patricia Wright in better days Patricia Wright was not one of the persons released last week. After being recommended for release during the last administration under Gov. Brown, Ms. Wright, who has had fourth stage cancer since she was in Northern California at Central California Womenâ€™s Facility (CCWF), now at the California Institute for Women (CIW) for a number of years, the cancer is now in her liver. She has had a double mastectomy and brain surgery for tumors. I remember visiting her at CCWF and how sheâ€™d get out of her bed into her wheelchair and meet with the visiting team. Wearing lipstick, a pretty scarf during those visits when her hair had fallen out from chemo, she was always cheerful and optimistic. We never thought she would still be behind bars. Her sister has started another petition. Please call the governorâ€™s office and ask him to release Patricia Wright. Prison is no place for a woman as sick as she is especially with a Covid-19 pandemic. The coronavirus is on everyoneâ€™s mind, especially those of us who cannot put six feet between ourselves and the next person, those who do not have masks or gloves and disinfectant to wipe hard surfaces in common areas â€“ I am speaking of those persons in prison and jail. I have been corresponding with several women for many years in California and recently the letters have become more urgent as women are afraid of what the pandemic means to their overall health and safety. The rules change daily as first the women have one hour of exercise a day and free calls to family twice a week to no time out of the cell â€“ medications brought to them and menu changes â€“ dinner was sandwiches Saturday, April 4. Ads by Revcontent 48,666 After reading her email, I had to call my friendâ€™s aunt to tell her that she would not be in touch anymore because of the â€œno phone calls.â€ I am happy some of the women have tablets so they can write and do their homework. And that for those who do not have tablets, the mailroom is still open. The fear is the guards will stop coming to work and there will be no one to run the prison; the women will just be locked in their cells without food and other supplies like toilet tissue, sanitary napkins, soap. Guards were taking the paper supplies from prison orderlies who supplied the bathrooms and did the cleaning. Obviously, paper goods stockpiling was not just a â€œfreeâ€ world phenomena. However, we are not talking Charmin or Scott towels. When the paper goods started disappearing, women prisoners began to worry about having enough food on hand just in case administrators disappeared and they were on their own, so there was also a dash for canteen products, just in case. Now with movement limited or stopped, I wonder how prisoners support themselves when they canâ€™t work. Has the state made plans to take care of the needs of all the prisoners given this new situation? Are they going to get a stipend to take care of their needs? No one has addressed this yet. In the â€œfreeâ€ world, we have unemployment benefits, which cover self-employment. Something needs to be in place for those people behind bars. Back to Patricia Wright, who is dying â€“ when one reviews her case, which was trumped up from the beginning, she should never have been locked up in the first place. From Schwarzenegger to Brown to now Newsom, her appeals for clemency have been denied. If she had had OJ Simpsonâ€™s money, the Los Angeles County DA, police and corrupt judges would not have had a case. From recanted statements to lost evidence to missing and manufactured documents, Patricia, who is blind, should be home with her family these final days of her life. Convicted 17 years after the event occurred, that she was the target of police department persecution for a conviction is one more nail in the coffin called justice. The Innocence Project has taken her case. Read about her case in the 2007 issue of â€œ â€ and also in the October 2011. Patricia Wrightâ€™s 9-year-old grandson wants so much to bring his grandma home before she dies that he decided to sell his tears to raise money for a lawyer. Patricia says he too has serious health challenges, a heart condition that is expected not to allow him to live longer than about three more years. His dream is to have grandma home, go on the Ellen Degeneres Show, meet Tyler Perry, have dinner with his family at Red Lobster and go to Disneyland. With vulnerable and elderly prisoners at the top of the list for release, we want the public to send letters to Gov. Newsom and to the Parole Board to have Patricia Wrightâ€™s LWOP commuted to Life with â€¦ so she can be released, if such hoops still need to be jumped through. She wrote me tonight and said she wasnâ€™t feeling well. Her sister Chantel told me that the chemotherapy that Patricia (68 now) has to leave the prison to go to a nearby hospital is really painful. It burns inside her veins. The blind, terminally ill woman with third stage breast and ovarian cancer also has asthma, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, osteoporosis, thyroid gland disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative disease of the back, chronic recurrent migraine headaches and chronic venous edema of the lower extremities. Patricia Wright, inmate number W79941, walks with the assistance of a cane and wheelchair and she is definitely not a threat to society. She is a rehabilitated devout Christian woman, with an excellent behavior record. Patricia has a commutation request, number COM 457-11 pending before Gov. Gavin Newsom. The California Constitution gives Gov. Newsom executive power to commute Patricia Wrightâ€™s sentence. Please sign her petition asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to commute Patricia Wrightâ€™s sentence to Life with the Possibility of Parole so Patricia can get her wish to go home and serve God with her family. The petition is on. I got this letter from another woman prisoner in California Friday, April 3, who, though younger than Patricia, is also very sick: Patricia Wrightâ€™s loving family is eager to bring her home and care for her. â€œDear Wanda, â€œI was in the clinic yesterday at 8:00 in the morning, when I saw an ambulance and immediately knew something was really wrong. I saw the inmate porters had masks on and I have one so I put it on. When I went to lab, I saw everyone was putting masks on and [I was] worried but trying to stay calm. â€œThe nurse who took my blood asked me if I was high risk. She told me she was high risk and that she has been asked why she continues to work. She told me â€˜Someone has to do it, right.â€™ I started crying because [there are] people like her who continue to put their lives on the line to save others. I thanked her from my heart. I started crying, because I felt the fear and concern the world is in. She tried to comfort me with her words and gave me two Purell hand sanitizer wipes saying, â€˜Here, take these. You might need them.â€™ â€œJust that gesture alone, that simple act of humanity, her own fear trying to be minimized by being kind to me. I realized I was trying to calm my own by crying in front of this stranger who understood my concern being that Iâ€™m high risk medical. â€œLater staff that have known me told me a nurse came in to 805 who tested positive. That they played cameras back and the other nurses that were around her were told to not come back (to self-quarantine). And that one inmate was quarantined. She was a nurse thatâ€™s training and I think on her first day. â€œAll this made me realize even more so the ugly reality of being in here while this virus has no mercy. Iâ€™m so scared for the world, but even more so for myself and everyone who is incarcerated. I canâ€™t give or get the social distance needed. Iâ€™m high risk medical heart, kidney, asthma, COPD, with other medical that they are trying to figure out. â€œMedical in here is not prepared for something like this. We donâ€™t have the space to social distance, they donâ€™t have the equipment or staff to deal with something of this magnitude. Look at the care we got before this virus. â€œWe are not getting the proper cleaning supplies. We need the same like what people are using out there: Lysol, bleach, paper towels etc. â€œWE ARE HUMAN!!! â€œIâ€™m scared. Itâ€™s not if the virus is going to come in here; itâ€™s when. The fact is it will. I canâ€™t get on a cellphone and FaceTime my family to be comforted. I wasnâ€™t sentenced to die in prison. The US Supreme Court said no death sentence to a juvenile offender and right now I feel like Iâ€™m being sentenced to death under the conditions Iâ€™m being made to live in. I wonâ€™t qualify for any releases they offer. Iâ€™m serving juvenile life without which says my life is not worth releasing. â€œIâ€™m so frustrated and scared and really Iâ€™m not the only one; just some suffer in silence. Yesterday they went around announcing that everyone with two months or less will be paroled by next week. That is helping none with the overcrowding. We are still at eight to a room that was made for four. Iâ€™ll write with more updates and whatever they give us.

Photo of Bill WITHERS; Posed portrait of Bill Withers (Photo by Gilles Petard/Redferns) Bill Withers (July 4, 1938-April 4, 2020) is going to be missed. With songs that spoke to what matters in life like his grandmother whoâ€™d been born in slavery, optimism, and the fact that if we plan on surviving as a species weâ€™re going to have to learn to â€œlean on each other.â€ His song â€œLean on Meâ€ should be Americaâ€™s new national anthem. Perhaps this is the Covid-19 lesson, how interdependent the biological systems, visible and hidden, are. A germ â€“ matter so tiny yet sturdy, it has brought nations to their collective knees while halting life as we know it. Free people are on house arrest and those arrested â€“ freed. Those unhoused, sheltered, starving fed, penniless given alms. Sounds biblical, like one of those Hollywood film scenarios popular at this time of year. With Lent, Feb. 26-April 9, overlapping Passover, April 8 â€“ April 16, and Ramadan, April 23-May 23, coming in a close third, perhaps all things happen in their proper season? Withers sings: â€œSometimes in our lives we all have pain We all have sorrow But if we are wise We know that thereâ€™s always tomorrow â€œLean on me, when youâ€™re not strong And Iâ€™ll be your friend Iâ€™ll help you carry on For it wonâ€™t be long â€˜Til Iâ€™m gonna need Somebody to lean on â€œPlease swallow your pride If I have things you need to borrow For no one can fill those of your needs That you wonâ€™t let show â€œYou just call on me, brother, when you need a hand We all need somebody to lean on I just might have a problem that youâ€™ll understand We all need somebody to lean on â€œIf there is a load you have to bear That you canâ€™t carry Iâ€™m right up the road Iâ€™ll share your load â€œIf you just call me (call me) If you need a friend (call me)â€ The old normal was not working, so this new normal is an opportunity to get closer to each other in ways that matter â€“ talking on the phone, using other electronic devices to deepen relationships. To â€œsocialize at a distanceâ€ is not the same as â€œsocial distancing.â€ If you notice, Gov. Newsom stopped staying the latter after he was corrected in his second or third press conference. Change the language, change the impact on behavior. Stay emotionally connected to your kinship group(s). Find creative ways to be together. Just imagine we are living in one of Octavia Butlerâ€™s dystopias. Blackness is indestructible, but we have to be smart and safe. Wear the masks when you feel your safety is compromised, that is, six feet is not consistently possible like while shopping, at work. Shelter in place except for essential tasks like shopping or work or caretaking. African Diaspora people are having trouble getting with the physical distancing; however, it is necessary. Make sure you take mental health breaks from all the technology, especially information. Do not watch the news and read the paper all day long. Also, with Zoom and other cyber realities â€“ control it, not the reverse, it you. Remember to turn off that screen and electrical deviceâ€“ take a break and get some sunshine. Go for a walk or bike ride. Paint, draw, sew, be creative. In Charles M. Blowâ€™s op ed in the April 1, 2020, New York Times, â€œ,â€ the author reflects on the persistence of racial inequity in medicine. There was a reason why African ancestors in America built Black hospitals. At the end of segregation, these hospitals might have closed, but the care did not follow when all the great Black doctors went to white institutions where Black patients, no matter how wealthy, received poor care. Is there any wonder why Black folks still distrust the American medical system? Today, in the midst of a global pandemic Black folks are being refused care, like the Nigerian college student in Kalamazoo who died late March after trying to get a test 3X and was sent home misdiagnosed after he presented with all the symptoms: fever, shortness of breath etc. My friendâ€™s daughter, seen at a clinic in Oakland, was not tested last week when she had flu-like symptoms. She was first sent home from Kaiser Oakland and then from La Clinica de la Raza to perhaps infect her parents and children and husband. Why are providers so stingy with the test? Her mother had to drive the next day from Vallejo to Hayward for a test. There are too many people in their home to just sit and wait. Why arenâ€™t Black people offered tests? Why canâ€™t all people take the test if that will make them feel safer and more comfortable? I heard from my therapist that the government is now going to started making home tests available. The question is to whom? I also heard Gov. Newsom say that Stanford now has a Covid-19 blood test. He also owned the stateâ€™s slow and inadequate response, from protective gear for providers to the test and analysis of results. Since when is the US government endowed with the right to limit health care access to a free people? Even slaves or imprisoned persons have the right to wellness and should have access to all the care options free people have. If I have healthcare coverage and even if I do not, I have a right to treatment, and I have a say over what happens to my body. It is my body. In a Town Hall Tele Meeting with Barbara Lee on April 2, she said that currently a report giving the racial demographics is being developed. In this article, the writer talks about treatment in NOLA and other Southern cities and states where Black people are not responding well to treatment and dying. Many of the men he mentions are young and have other medical conditions like diabetes and/or HIV or hypertension. With predictions about how many people will die and prescriptions that tell people to â€œsocially distanceâ€ and â€œisolateâ€ rather than â€œphysically distanceâ€ or â€œsocialize at a distance,â€ we are seeing fear generated as we settle into this new norm. All of a sudden, when we call a person nowadays, they actually pick up and want to talk. We need to cherish this moment and never return to a time when we were too busy chasing waterfalls to show that we care. Love is all that matters â€¦ on the eve of the anniversary of the killing of Dr. King, April 4, 1968. â€œStill Billâ€ (2007) directed by Damani Baker and Alex Vlast, is available on YouTube. I interviewed Damani 10 years ago when the film screened at the Oakland International Film Festival and then had a theatrical release in San Francisco. I hosted a special tribute for Bill Withers and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Saturday, April 4. Visit On Friday, April 3, I hosted a two-hour National Poetry Month kick off with 20 poets, among them three poet laureates. We also remember the legacy of Rev. Dr. King with poetry and music. Visit . Each Friday in April, at 9:30 a.m. PT, we will feature poets and their poetry. Also on Wandaâ€™s Picks Radio Show, I am curating shows that speak to survival strategies for people of African Descent. I call the programs Melanin Magic Sessions. We have had four thus far and continue Wednesday, April 8. There is a series of Virtual African American Townhall Series which looks at the impact of Covid-19 on the psyche, the pocket book, education and legal rights. Panelists or facilitators address these areas with an opportunity for a conversation with the audience at the end. It is practical and we leave with tools and there is an opportunity for follow-up. These folks do not talk at us; they are working with us so we can have a healthy response to this phenomenon, Covid-19. I have Wanda Whitaker on Wandaâ€™s Picks Radio show April 1 to talk about the series. Visit . The Virtual African American Townhall Series continues each Thursday in April, on April 9, 16 and 23, 11 a.m.-1 p.m. PT. Itâ€™s free on Zoom, but you have to register. My suggestion is to register for all of them at once. The limit is 100 and if you want to catch it live, register in advance. I found the information useful and practical and the presenters really engaging. Go to Eventbrite: . . Visit her website at throughout the month for updates to Wandaâ€™s Picks, her blog, photos and . Her shows are streamed live Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 a.m., can be heard by phone at 347-237-4610 and are archived at. The post appeared first on. Source:

Shield Breaker said: I've been hearing that it's going to decimate us poor flyover ghouls for months now, but the only ones I see getting screwed are the big cities. That's because the cities are full of sin, but the 'flyover' states are filled with God-fearing, patriotic, clean-living types. I would say 'keep going to church' but maybe 'keep joining the church services by video conference from your Lysol scented house' is more pragmatic at the moment.
Since Iâ€™m in the middle of a Covid-19 hot spot, hereâ€™s a tip for some of my brothers where it hasnâ€™t hit hard yet. Buy some hand sanitizer for when youâ€™re out an about and canâ€™t wash your hands. Lysol spray, Clorox wipes to sanitize door handles and other frequently touched surfaces. I sanitize anything i bring into the house, groceries included. Nitrile gloves and some sort of disposable face masks. If not any sort of cloth face mask will do (balaclava, motorcycle riding mask etc.) These items are almost impossible to find locally. An immune system booster such as airborne or emergen-c. And make sure you have a bottle of Tylenol, just in case you get a fever. Theyâ€™re saying ibuprofen makes corona virus symptoms worse.
So I donâ€™t know if they just did a update to the information on Lysol and what it kills and takes care of but can someone explain to me why it mentions #coronavirus when this is the first time we have heard of this #virus.... I donâ€™t know about yâ€™all but just be on the watch
So someone said this the other day and i want to reinterate this point. Reckitt makes both addiction meds & Lysol. Kinda odd that they arent losing $$ during the covid-19 virus. Ahhh seems a little strange for me. I believe in facts and i would love to know these facts.Research?
Stop telling us to clean and disinfect everything when the stores are out of sanitizer, Lysol, antibacterial anything, isopropyl alcohol, hyrogen peroxide, bleach, hand soap and paper towels. Can't pay a $100 for a can of Lysol on ebay. #COVID19

This girl on Facebook just posted a picture of the back of a Lysol can (where it tells you the germs it kills) and thought it was the ingredients and said â€œSo Iâ€™m cleaning my counters with corona virus??â€ You really canâ€™t make this shit up...
This virus is real...I believe it's been here it's. just a strong ðŸ’ª strand of what has already been here when i tell you i had alll of these symptoms didn't know how it appeared in my life to make the long story short I couldn't understand what was happening but I also know it was designed to take me out . I remember buying Lysol bleach all the this that is sold out in stores so you can protect yourself so I thought but anyways I went to the doctor three times they could not tell me what was going on I was sick coughing watery head up temperature afraid to be around other people so I wouldn't go in the store if it was a lot of people in the store I will go in a store I remember looking around trying to figure out why nobody else wasn't going through what I was going through i had been praying to God to help me i brought a hold lot of stuff for your immune system even try a whole bunch of home remedy because I couldn't figure it out what was going on with me this happened at the end of 2017 on til the whole Year of 2018 so one day i wake up and i didn't have them system anymore you cant even imagine how i mush have felt that then let me know always protect yourself especially when you're in public ....plzzz be safe God blessðŸ™

Triniqueen77 said: â†‘ Congrats on your sobriety OP! I'm so proud of you, I'm rooting for you! Have you tried speaking to the person in charge about social distancing and who they let into the house? Do you have anything to sanitize with? Alcohol? Lysol wipes? Peroxide? Did you make any masks or buy any? See if you can get those things in order if you can. You can buy 99 percent alcohol and try to make your own hand sanitizer or disinfectant spray. This pandemic will mess with you mentally, even before we were on high alert I was afraid to come around my friend's baby because I was scared I would give him something. I'm on vacation right now though so I've taken precautions and worn a mask while social distancing so I feel better coming around him. She has errands and I watch him sometimes. You mentioned your dad's place though and I know you are worried but I'm worried about you too. Do you have any masks or anything to make masks because I feel like you should try to isolate and stay away from people for a few days to make sure you show no symptoms? I'm hoping you aren't one of the persons where it takes 2 weeks to show symptoms. So I was wondering if you could hang by him when you think it's safe? I don't even know if I'm giving you any really good advice I just want you to be safe and sober. You are in my prays! Thank you for your response! I have masks - I have a coworker who gave me some back in late February - and we have a supply of gloves in the house anyway for cleaning and for handling drug tests. I had already asked my dad about staying with him but he was uneasy about it. This was in the middle of last week when things were getting really bad in our city so I absolutely donâ€™t blame him. I think if Iâ€™m just honest with my roomies and they can maintain an open mind about making some changes for ALL of our well beings, everything will be ok. Fingers crossed and take care of yourself as well through all of this!

Well our household snack and food offense has been amazing. Defensively Iâ€™m running out of Lysol wipes. Special Teams is excelling with the streaming options. RT @JimNagy_SB: If weâ€™re roughly halfway thru Covid-19 pandemic, what halftime adjustment are you making? What havenâ€™t you done so far during the quarantine that you want to before it ends?
We've done two take out meals since this started. One from our favorite sushi place. Order placed online, fully paid online. Walk up to pickup window and grab bag along with a disinfectant wipe. Second one from a family run pizza place. Paid on the phone. Drive up. get handed the boxes. Wish I could get some of our favorite Mexican food but they require you to come in, pay in person. That's a deal killer. We have a mudroom. The process for everything is the same. Come in from the garage, take off shoes and put on slippers. Enter hallway and drop everything on the counter in the mudroom. WASH HANDS. Put on gloves. Remove all the packaging from takeout and put food on paper plates. Holler upstairs for one H or DS to come down and take the paper plated food upstairs. Walk back out thru garage (open door with elbow or with a wipe). Throw out the packaging. Take off gloves and trow away. Re-enter and wash hands. Lysol counter. Go eat. We had a wonderfully warm and sunny day a few days ago. I left my car outside with the windows down for a couple of hours. Then, closed windows and let it all 'bake' for a few more hours.
What Disinfectants work against COVID-19? Common Disinfectants: Disinfecting wipes such as Clorox or Lysol Disinfectant sprays Isopropyl alcohol Hydrogen peroxide https://cleanarrivalhomeservices.com/services/coronavirus-house-cleaning-tips/ #pdx #coronavirus #covid-19
What I am seeing a lot of is that sellers will list an item if it relates to the corona virus in some way (like isopropyl alcohol, Lysol, bleach) at somewhat reasonable prices and then have shipping charges that is 10X what they should be. For example ( real listings): Clorox Degreasing Dishwashing Liquid With OXI Fresh Scent Blue Bleach Free 10oz $4.00 Shipping $64.90 Soft ScrubÂ® Total All-Purpose Cleanser with Bleach, 25.4 oz, Spray $21.97 Shipping $20.00 CLEANER Clean-up Kills 99.9% spray with bleach 2-pack SHIPS SAME DAY Shipping $61.50
WHO apparently never read what viruses a can of Lysol spray will kill, "Human Coronavirus"..... It says so! RT @RyanAFournier: The World Health Organization said in January that this virus had NO human-to-human transmission. The WHO should be investigated for how they handled the Coronavirus, And their ties to China. Who agrees?

Ya know....commercials in 2030 be like "Were you or someone you know overly expose to Lysol, Clorox, Hand Sanitizers during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic? If so, you may be eligible for compensation....call 1 800......"
Yes check a lysol can you will find it RT @Carroll_322: Thread. Coronavirus is old been around a long time. This version is a sophisticated Bioweapon created in the BSL 4 in Wuhan just a couple blocks from the wet market. It did not escape the lab but was intentionally released.
Yes. I was at work one night and was cleaning with Lysol wipes and it said it disinfected against coronavirus so I looked it up and did some research because well why would these wipes bought months before Co-vid came to be have that? There's many different strains of it that exists. Felines, bats. It's an animal virus. I believe we had an outbreak of SARS once. You'd have to look it up. It's a whole different strain in felines. I too have cats.

@AlyssaOsenbruck Corona virus is a category of viruses. The cold and flu are versions of the corona virus. What people are calling today the "coronavirus" is actually titled COVID-19. Lysol kills corona viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
@andre_desoto @Reverend_Ducati @RobProvince Your blowup doll doesn't show emotions because she's inflatable. I'm sorry you were led to believe she represented actual women. Now, waddle off and clean her up with Lysol wipes so you don't get coronavirus on your tiny peen.
@BarbLarochelle Except Lysol Wipes are not on the approved hard surface disinfectants.. Lysol aerosol is though.. https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/list.html
@Cali_DreamsXO None of these kill it actually. But wipe downs are more affective. Itâ€™s a novel virus so we donâ€™t have any aerosol sprays that actually can neutralize COVID-19. You wipe down in hopes of removing it. Spraying Lysol doesnâ€™t really do anything.
@DailyCaller COVID-19, Wuhan Flu, Coronavirus... â€”and nowâ€” Novel Coronavirus Hmmmm...Guess they're really trying to drive it home that this is a NEW Coronavirus, not the 'Human Coronavirus' listed on the back of Lysol. I'm glad this is being clarified, but why can't there be just one name?
@Dammit_Ange You can go to the cdc website and there is a list of disinfectants that you can use to sanitize. Clorox and Lysol were both on there, as well as hydrogen peroxide. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html

A friend sent me this.

As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK. There is no 'pandemic', it's all a ruse. This virus is cover for the deaths experienced by the activation of 5G cells in Wuhan, China. Italy experienced many deaths as well when they activated their 5G systems. The telecom companies are not about to take the blame for their "safe" 5G systems and instead the power elite created a 'killer' virus to distract the unthinking masses. The truth is out there yet people are not capable of doing their own research, instead, giving away their rights to a Banker Cabal government controlled narrative. Sure, the coronavirus is real, just look at any can of Lysol; it says it on the can: Lysol kills coronavirus and rhinovirus among others. KPIX and their staff are just controlled media hacks, and stooges. The truth is our government is stealing our time and money. What we are witnessing is the advent of totalitarian New World Order.
Awesome song You are exactly right, the greedy ones taking all they can and leaving hardly anything behind for the rest. People need to remember what they was taught share, take some and leave some so everyone can get something. I was at Martin's grocery store a week ago and the shelves was bare. So yesterday I went back and this older lady was standing next too me. I noticed two cans of lysol disinfectant and she didn't, I could have been a ass hat and took both of them. But I said look do you need one. She looked and said yea I do and I handed her one of them. We have to be sure everyone has stuff keep homes full of food and other essential stuff
Before everyone freaks: Read a Lysol can. Corona virus has been listed on there for years. This is a different strain we are battling this year.
Boomers love to hear themselves talk. Plus they own all the COVID-19 face masks like billionaires. Boomers want masks just for themselves and not you. They need to wait in mile-long lines at Costco for blessed toilet paper and sanctified Lysol.
Can't find Lysol anywhere? You might already have what you need. https://www.pipelinenews.ca/news/local-news/you-might-already-have-something-that-kills-covid-19-1.24112679 #covid19 #oilandgas #oilindustry
CDC has informed and knows that the virus does not last very long on surfaces. You can just not touch it and wash your hands after setting it down for a few hours to a full day until the virus dries up and dies. Wipe the cover well with a disinfectant wipe (lysol or clorox wipe) and you can use a clorox or lysol or any disinfectant spray to fan through the pages and spray them lighty with a disinfectant spray. Be careful with bleach based sprays, they could damage the book by removing the ink.Â Or you can just throw it out and get a new one. If you choose to dispose of it be sure to seal it in it's own plastic air-tight bag to lock any contaminents on it in so it doesn't have the possability of infecting anyone.

Corona Viruses are found in people thats why the lysol can stated it's effective against human Corona and but covid19 crossed from animals to people and its referred to as Novel or new Corona
Coronavirus been out rather some know it or not,look on the can of Lysol. It tells you that it kills the Coronavirus and it's been on the cans for a while. The 5g that is 20 times more stronger than 4g is the problem. Get you some orgonite pyramids or crystals to protect you from EMF,people read about it.
Coronavirus version of monthly subscription boxes might begin first month with a roll of Charmin, a roll of Viva paper towels, and a can of Lysol. #LifeInTheTimeOfCorona
Costco will not allow returns on high-demand items like toilet paper, water and more Signs spotted at several Costco locations are warning customers returns won't be accepted for select items that have flown off the shelves. March 19, 2020, 3:38 PM EDT / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump As millions of people rush to stock up on goods amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Costco is starting to take hoarding seriously. Signs seen at various Costco locations have indicated that many stores will not be accepting returns for high-demand items like toilet paper, bottled water and sanitizing wipes, which have all recently flown off store shelves cross the country. Instagram accounts that keep track of developments at Costco, but are not affiliated with the company, have recently posted photos of signs at different locations listing items that will not be accepted as returns. "So happy Costco is making this move!" the CostcoInsider account wrote. "Good! Hoarders are stuck with it,'' one commenter replied. The items listed are toilet paper, paper towels, sanitizing wipes, water, rice and Lysol. Panic buying leaves empty shelves at supermarkets and stores MARCH 16, 202001:53 It's unclear whether this a now company-wide policy, or one that has only been instituted by individual locations. A representative from Costco was not immediately available for comment Thursday. Empty shelves have been seen at major retailers and grocery stores across the country following a wave of panic buying as more states institute stricter measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. Some major supermarkets, like H-E-B and Wegmans, have tried to curb hoarding by limiting customer purchases of in-demand items. Costco has also enacted similar policies at some of its stores, but only started enforcing it this week. Other grocery chains like Kroger and Walmart have limited their hours to deal with the high demand. Costco is refusing returns on high-demand items like toilet paper, water

Darwin Award... In a long-winded Facebook rant Sehlke claimed that â€œour government is under attack from withinâ€ while comparing the coronavirus to â€œthe impeachment hoaxâ€ and arguing that those who take the current pandemic seriously â€œpanic like sheep.â€ Wake up!!! This is what the beginning of socialism looks like! â€¦ They are leading with fear causing you to panic like sheep. â€¦ You donâ€™t need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!

Do you think that it's a reasonable expectation that a gas station employee should be responsible for sanitizing washrooms to the degree required to ensure that Covid 19 isn't transmitted? Should we be asking truckers to take the risk that the washrooms were cleaned properly? It takes a little more than a can of Lysol - and with the shortages of cleaning supplies everywhere, having random stations open and stocked is less efficient than actually planning this on a regional level.
Does anyone know if just wearing cotton gloves, like winter gloves would be good in protecting me & my family against #germs , #COVID19 , #coronavirus ? Would I have to wash after every use? Disinfect after each use (w/#lysol ) ? Wash every day? I have no disposable gloves &
Does Lysol wipes or spray kill Coronavirus on surfaces?

God might have gone a little too far this time. An actual plague before Passover? Seriously? And not just against Egyptians â€” but everyone, including Jews? The Chosen People, especially Orthodox Jews, given the early outbreak in New Rochelle, New York, have no immunity to a modern-day plague that plays no favorites and refuses to pass over anyone â€” even on the holiday of Passover. We now all are exiled â€” not in the desert or even the Diaspora â€” but to dreary self-quarantines and the anxiety from incomplete and convoluted information. Lives have been placed on hold while those untested for the coronavirus wait for symptoms to appear. In the meantime, we have ritualized handwashing, treating it like a daily prayer, repeatedly performed while playing double-dutch with scalding water. The consequences of the coronavirus will be severe. Books will be written about it as a history lesson, public policy manual and morality tale, serving as global Haggadahs of remembrance. Millions will die; many more will be sick. The sadistic properties of COVID-19 are such that possibly millions more infected will show no symptoms at all. It is a sickness playing Russian roulette with all of humanity. The proximity to Passover, the way COVID-19 quarantined the Jewish world just when the community normally comes together is leavened with great meaning. As viruses go, this one produced the ultimate Passover paradox. Individual members of families will sit in separate rooms in compliance with seder distancing. Many will skip seders altogether. What else can one do? The exacting rituals of the holiday are wholly untenable and too unsanitary to perform. Reciting the biblical plagues requires the dipping of fingers into wine glasses 10 times! What does the Talmud say about latex gloves? The four questions will be left unanswered because even the Wise Son has no idea how to â€œflatten the curve.â€ Seders the world over will feature an abundance of empty seats for Elijah, who, this year, will be wearing a mask. The Red Sea will remain at high tide. Signs and Wonders are suspended until further notice âˆ’ or until a vaccine is found. Â â€œCOVID-19 has created a blockade not seen since the British Mandate.â€ This is one heartless, joyless virus. Those most susceptible, the elderly, who the coronavirus favors most cruelly, happen to be the ones most indispensable to the seder experience. What kind of a seder leaves grandparents alone in their homes, apartments and elder-care facilities? But we canâ€™t have them anywhere near coughing children scampering for the afikomen. What alternatives are there? The new normal in seder etiquette requires an ingenuity far beyond the making of flourless cake and tiramisu for dessert. This moment requires special cleaning instructions that surpass the usual search-and-destroy mission on chametz. Weâ€™re talking Lysol tsunamis. A stray morsel of bread is of lesser significance than airborne COVID-19 droplets. Donâ€™t be surprised to see a seder guest in a HAZMAT suit. This is why people and communities are scheduling virtual seders as part of an overall mitigation strategy. Welcome to digital seders via FaceTime and Zoom. Good luck with that. It will look as though â€œThe Brady Bunchâ€ and â€œHollywood Squaresâ€ converted to Judaism. Dozing off without anyone noticing will be a challenge. Drones will be called in to uncover the afikomen. Any mention of the Ten Commandments being brought down from Mt. Sinai will cause genuine confusion for those using their own tablets. Letâ€™s face it: The liberation story of Passover is a misnomer this year. You can point to the Haggadah as precedent all you want, but it wonâ€™t lift the curfews and quarantines. We are dealing with an 11th plague without mercy. Lambsâ€™ blood on doorposts is no inoculate. The coronavirus has made its presence known in the land of our biblical ancestors. The Jewish State of Israel is under quarantine, too. Throughout its modern history and endlessly fought wars (often with those same Egyptians), never before has there been a disruption to the making of aliyah. COVID-19 has created a blockade not seen since the British Mandate. â€œNext year in Jerusalem,â€ the coda to every seder and the longing to return after a 2,000-year absence was, for Jews âˆ’ until the creation of Israel âˆ’ just wish-fulfillment that ended seders but could not put an end to our exile. This year, it might become a trending phrase among the Diaspora. American, Canadian and European Jews once believed all it took were plane tickets on El Al; for the time being, travel restrictions to Israel remain one of the cruel jokes of this Passover. Fleeing Jews have a better chance of seeing the Pyramids than the Western Wall. Slavery itself takes on new meaning in the form of mandatory stay-at-home orders. Admittedly, it is more polite bondage. There are no mud and whips, but the despair and loneliness that comes with isolation will be unabated. At least the Israelites had one another. However, no one can miss the irony: We are about to commemorate an exodus amid present-day confinement. Our movement has come to a halt. Everything about our once-frenzied, mobile lives is suspended, placed on hiatus, postponed indefinitely. Wandering Jews now are forcibly stationary. New York City subways, London tubes and LAâ€™s 405 are eerily empty. Home confinement put an end to all that gridlock. â€œWandering Jews now are forcibly stationary.â€ Momentarily overcoming his speech impediment, Moses delivered to Pharaoh what still is the most declarative ultimatum on behalf of the Jewish people: â€œLet my people go!â€ Today, our plea is far more modest and directed not to a pharaoh, but to any deity or epidemiologist willing to listen: â€œPlease, just let my people go â€¦ outside.â€ Of course, the fact the coronavirus spares no one is no reason for implacable anti-Semites not to charge Jews with having caused it. The ancient blood libel against Jews has always lacked imagination. It has surfaced throughout history as a most stubborn and adaptable urban legend, even in places where there are no Jews. Isnâ€™t the coronavirus bad enough without perpetuating absurd lies? Christian pastor Rick Wiles recently delivered a sermon scapegoating Jews as the perpetrators of a coronavirus conspiracy, all emanating from synagogues. Sound familiar? That medieval canard of disease-carrying Jews is alive and well, no matter the pandemic. How many Jews live in the Wuhan Province of China, do you figure? Meanwhile, officials from both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas publicly blamed Israel for deliberately spreading the coronavirus within the territories. Anti-Semites throughout history may have been underachievers, but they never failed to display tremendous resourcefulness in tailoring the blood libel to apply to new situations. Donâ€™t allow a global catastrophe to go to waste without pointing the finger of blame at the Jews â€” whether in the form of the bubonic plague, 9/11, financial collapse and crashes, and, of course, mysteriously â€œmissingâ€ Christian children, as if their blood actually improved the taste of matzo. Note to Jew-haters everywhere: There is no â€œkavodâ€ to having COVID-19. But all is not lost. Curiously, without a medical cure, we have been preparing for the coronavirus for decades now. The introduction of the Internet and the rise of social media fortuitously and in some cosmic way, have allowed us to be in rehearsal for this very moment. Social distancing has been in progress all along, and the distance between us has continued to expand exponentially. We never realized all this â€œstaying apart while pretending to be togetherâ€ one day would become a necessity because of a global pandemic that absolutely forbade social contact. Tragic in so many ways, COVID-19 now makes official and even tests the dramatic asocial, pseudo-social changes in our lives. The pandemic exiled everyone to the claustrophobic confines of their own homes. But we were more than ready for it. We already had outfitted our homes with the toys and tools that would fortify us for such trials in hibernation. Hopefully, this forced isolation wonâ€™t make permanent what we believed we could take back â€” if our grand experiment in distancing left us emotionally unmoored and simply too far apart physically. We knew all along that the â€œsocialâ€ part of the social network always belonged in quotations. Surely, we were never so foolish as to believe Facebook was the equal of actual socialization. Yet we perfected such efficient but empty contact with other human beings, and bought into the premises of a forever isolating, shrinking existence. The moment of truth has arrived. It is the culminating triumph of social media itself, the endgame we were lulled into adopting, the complacency of the couch potato, homebody, video-gamer, Facebook voyeur â€” all packaged into one pale, lonely face. Face-to-face contact with friends and family rapidly has been vanishing with each passing year. Hearing an actual voice was replaced by the reading of atonal texts. Along the way, we forgot that pressing the send button is no substitute for human intimacy. At least there is Siri and Alexa. We voluntarily self-quarantined so many facets of our lives, and it should serve us well during this health crisis. Gone are Sunday strolls, gym pit-stops and coffee runs. The virtual has replaced the actual. Human personality filtered through machines became our preferred mode of contact with others, warping our connection to the living world. The art of life indoors and the severing of human interaction evolved into performance art. No one seemed to pay any attention to the deadening of our senses, the atrophying of our sight and smell. Â â€œAnti-Semites throughout history may have been underachievers, but they never failed to display tremendous resourcefulness in tailoring the blood libel to apply to new situations.â€ Even our minds have narrowed to better fit our respective captivities. Tweets limited the scope of conversations. News websites with their meddlesome beeping notifications closed us off from differing opinions. We have been left alone with our confirmation biases intact, the cacophony and rigid partisanship of cable news only reinforcing what we already believe and what we steadfastly refuse to know. More and more people already had shifted to teleworking and telecommuting. Yes, it added efficiency to the workplace, but it also slowly eliminated the experience of going to an office altogether â€” and put an end to the once-essential socialization of watercooler gossip. The cyber economy, combined with free shipping and delivery, eliminated the experience of actually going to a market. Cyber Monday is every day. Making selections that required the discernment of human touch ended. Being â€œpickyâ€ became overrated, then lost all meaning. While weâ€™re home, why bother sweating outdoors? The Peloton bicycle not only created virtual spin classes, but also introduced the delusion of bouncing on cobblestones while traversing the Tour de France â€” all while going nowhere. Online courses made a college degree possible without stepping foot on an actual leafy or ivy-covered campus. Receiving a degree over the Internet gave new meaning to home-schooling. It didnâ€™t actually matter if you were wearing pants to class. Weâ€™re now all on the full digital package. The Internet is our one reliable lifeline in the coronavirus darkness. This simplified all the health risks that came with our immune from contagion, The only marginal benefit that arises from this altered way of life is the death blow it already has dealt to stalkers, perverts and the paparazzi. Home confinement comes with certain advantages: the maintenance of a strictly private life for those who want it. And, of course, the coronavirus may save some marriages from the hurt and betrayal caused by now-aborted marital affairs. All this enforced seclusion comes with its own possibilities for reflection. With all this spare time on our hands â€” when weâ€™re not washing them â€” we should consider whether our acquired digital skills actually readied us for the challenges the coronavirus presents. Hereâ€™s an early verdict: Weâ€™re already going stir-crazy. How much banana cake and peanut butter cookies can a family possibly consume? How many cringing lip-syncing performances can be posted on Instagram? How many home workouts without any exercise equipment can be devised for the cardio-addict grounded by COVID-19? There are so many things one can Google, websites to surf, postings that receive your like(s) on Facebook, and the cute but now nauseating photos and videos on Instagram created as a public service to entertain increasingly cramped Friends. Skype and Facetime do not make a life. And if the perfect mate has been discovered online, all will be unrequited and unsatisfied until there is an actual meeting in the flesh. We are left to wonder whether this time spent disconnected from people will even be well-spent. Will keeping our distance coincide with retaining our humanity? We must remain mindful of the tragic circumstances that forced us inside: the vast numbers the coronavirus killed, and those who would not have survived had it not been for available respirators. With no panacea in sight, this Passover is all too sobering â€” and not just because many of us will be without our five cups of wine. If anything, these past few weeks â€” now combined with a radically improvised Passover â€” has revealed our many vulnerabilities. Yes, the iPhone is a miracle device, but while in the midst of a global pandemic, we somehow donâ€™t have enough surgical masks for healthcare workers or beds for patients stricken with COVID-19. What does that tell us? Many things. But most importantly: We are far from invincible. The world-beaters and machers among us were not more resilient. They just had a second, more-secluded home to which to escape. But once there, they, too, were forced to sit, fidget and wait. â€œWe remain hopeful that soon, we will glimpse a return to normalcy, salvage our future and emerge from our remote locations, squinting in the light of an unfamiliar sky.â€ Perhaps all this homebound confinement for Jews âˆ’ at least, during this time of year âˆ’ brings us closer to a shared experience in bondage with our biblical forebears. After all, we are reminded each Passover that eating matzo and avoiding leavened grains are only parts of a Jewâ€™s obligation to imagine a hasty exit across a desert. Jews also must adopt the fiction that they once were slaves in Egypt; not just to imagine it, but to feel it. This bit of Haggadah hubris always bordered on chutzpah. How can we possibly identify with the Jews who built the pyramids? How can we imagine our backs scarred from repeated whippings? Doing so trivialized the experiences of actual Jewish slaves. The tragedy and inconvenience of the coronavirus bring us no closer to them, either. Itâ€™s just another plague that reinforces we havenâ€™t figured everything yet. COVID-19 might have little in common with locusts, frogs and hail and, hopefully, it will prove to be far less deadly than the killing of the firstborn. But like it or not, from now on, it will serve as a coda to the Haggadah, an ill-timed update to the Passover story âˆ’ one we all will seek to vaccinate against once we make our exodus from home confinement. There is one definitive, and unflattering, takeaway from this tragedy. We are uncomfortably reminded that it is, for the most part, only on Passover when we make a commitment to see one another. Family gatherings depended on a breadless holiday. Without it, we would be strangers not just in a strange land but, tragically, to one another. After the holiday, families dispersed until next year. Our seder plates this year will have the bonus symbolism that we should not take next yearâ€™s seder for granted. In the meantime, we remain hopeful that soon, we will glimpse a return to normalcy, salvage our future and emerge from our remote locations, squinting in the light of an unfamiliar sky. Because this holiday requires the asking of questions, the Simple Sons among us will wonder why this light is not blue like our only companions, those devices always blinking back at us.

We voluntarily self-quarantined so many facets of our lives, and it should serve us well during this health crisis. Gone are Sunday strolls, gym pit-stops and coffee runs. The virtual has replaced the actual. Human personality filtered through machines became our preferred mode of contact with others, warping our connection to the living world. The art of life indoors and the severing of human interaction evolved into performance art. No one seemed to pay any attention to the deadening of our senses, the atrophying of our sight and smell. Â â€œAnti-Semites throughout history may have been underachievers, but they never failed to display tremendous resourcefulness in tailoring the blood libel to apply to new situations.â€ Even our minds have narrowed to better fit our respective captivities. Tweets limited the scope of conversations. News websites with their meddlesome beeping notifications closed us off from differing opinions. We have been left alone with our confirmation biases intact, the cacophony and rigid partisanship of cable news only reinforcing what we already believe and what we steadfastly refuse to know. More and more people already had shifted to teleworking and telecommuting. Yes, it added efficiency to the workplace, but it also slowly eliminated the experience of going to an office altogether â€” and put an end to the once-essential socialization of watercooler gossip. The cyber economy, combined with free shipping and delivery, eliminated the experience of actually going to a market. Cyber Monday is every day. Making selections that required the discernment of human touch ended. Being â€œpickyâ€ became overrated, then lost all meaning. While weâ€™re home, why bother sweating outdoors? The Peloton bicycle not only created virtual spin classes, but also introduced the delusion of bouncing on cobblestones while traversing the Tour de France â€” all while going nowhere. Online courses made a college degree possible without stepping foot on an actual leafy or ivy-covered campus. Receiving a degree over the Internet gave new meaning to home-schooling. It didnâ€™t actually matter if you were wearing pants to class. Weâ€™re now all on the full digital package. The Internet is our one reliable lifeline in the coronavirus darkness. This simplified all the health risks that came with our immune from contagion, The only marginal benefit that arises from this altered way of life is the death blow it already has dealt to stalkers, perverts and the paparazzi. Home confinement comes with certain advantages: the maintenance of a strictly private life for those who want it. And, of course, the coronavirus may save some marriages from the hurt and betrayal caused by now-aborted marital affairs. All this enforced seclusion comes with its own possibilities for reflection. With all this spare time on our hands â€” when weâ€™re not washing them â€” we should consider whether our acquired digital skills actually readied us for the challenges the coronavirus presents. Hereâ€™s an early verdict: Weâ€™re already going stir-crazy. How much banana cake and peanut butter cookies can a family possibly consume? How many cringing lip-syncing performances can be posted on Instagram? How many home workouts without any exercise equipment can be devised for the cardio-addict grounded by COVID-19? There are so many things one can Google, websites to surf, postings that receive your like(s) on Facebook, and the cute but now nauseating photos and videos on Instagram created as a public service to entertain increasingly cramped Friends. Skype and Facetime do not make a life. And if the perfect mate has been discovered online, all will be unrequited and unsatisfied until there is an actual meeting in the flesh. We are left to wonder whether this time spent disconnected from people will even be well-spent. Will keeping our distance coincide with retaining our humanity? We must remain mindful of the tragic circumstances that forced us inside: the vast numbers the coronavirus killed, and those who would not have survived had it not been for available respirators. With no panacea in sight, this Passover is all too sobering â€” and not just because many of us will be without our five cups of wine. If anything, these past few weeks â€” now combined with a radically improvised Passover â€” has revealed our many vulnerabilities. Yes, the iPhone is a miracle device, but while in the midst of a global pandemic, we somehow donâ€™t have enough surgical masks for healthcare workers or beds for patients stricken with COVID-19. What does that tell us? Many things. But most importantly: We are far from invincible. The world-beaters and machers among us were not more resilient. They just had a second, more-secluded home to which to escape. But once there, they, too, were forced to sit, fidget and wait. â€œWe remain hopeful that soon, we will glimpse a return to normalcy, salvage our future and emerge from our remote locations, squinting in the light of an unfamiliar sky.â€ Perhaps all this homebound confinement for Jews âˆ’ at least, during this time of year âˆ’ brings us closer to a shared experience in bondage with our biblical forebears. After all, we are reminded each Passover that eating matzo and avoiding leavened grains are only parts of a Jewâ€™s obligation to imagine a hasty exit across a desert. Jews also must adopt the fiction that they once were slaves in Egypt; not just to imagine it, but to feel it. This bit of Haggadah hubris always bordered on chutzpah. How can we possibly identify with the Jews who built the pyramids? How can we imagine our backs scarred from repeated whippings? Doing so trivialized the experiences of actual Jewish slaves. The tragedy and inconvenience of the coronavirus bring us no closer to them, either. Itâ€™s just another plague that reinforces we havenâ€™t figured everything yet. COVID-19 might have little in common with locusts, frogs and hail and, hopefully, it will prove to be far less deadly than the killing of the firstborn. But like it or not, from now on, it will serve as a coda to the Haggadah, an ill-timed update to the Passover story âˆ’ one we all will seek to vaccinate against once we make our exodus from home confinement. There is one definitive, and unflattering, takeaway from this tragedy. We are uncomfortably reminded that it is, for the most part, only on Passover when we make a commitment to see one another. Family gatherings depended on a breadless holiday. Without it, we would be strangers not just in a strange land but, tragically, to one another. After the holiday, families dispersed until next year. Our seder plates this year will have the bonus symbolism that we should not take next yearâ€™s seder for granted. In the meantime, we remain hopeful that soon, we will glimpse a return to normalcy, salvage our future and emerge from our remote locations, squinting in the light of an unfamiliar sky. Because this holiday requires the asking of questions, the Simple Sons among us will wonder why this light is not blue like our only companions, those devices always blinking back at us.

God might have gone a little too far this time. An actual plague before Passover? Seriously? And not just against Egyptians â€” but everyone, including Jews? The Chosen People, especially Orthodox Jews, given the early outbreak in New Rochelle, New York, have no immunity to a modern-day plague that plays no favorites and refuses to pass over anyone â€” even on the holiday of Passover. We now all are exiled â€” not in the desert or even the Diaspora â€” but to dreary self-quarantines and the anxiety from incomplete and convoluted information. Lives have been placed on hold while those untested for the coronavirus wait for symptoms to appear. In the meantime, we have ritualized handwashing, treating it like a daily prayer, repeatedly performed while playing double-dutch with scalding water. The consequences of the coronavirus will be severe. Books will be written about it as a history lesson, public policy manual and morality tale, serving as global Haggadahs of remembrance. Millions will die; many more will be sick. The sadistic properties of COVID-19 are such that possibly millions more infected will show no symptoms at all. It is a sickness playing Russian roulette with all of humanity. The proximity to Passover, the way COVID-19 quarantined the Jewish world just when the community normally comes together is leavened with great meaning. As viruses go, this one produced the ultimate Passover paradox. Individual members of families will sit in separate rooms in compliance with seder distancing. Many will skip seders altogether. What else can one do? The exacting rituals of the holiday are wholly untenable and too unsanitary to perform. Reciting the biblical plagues requires the dipping of fingers into wine glasses 10 times! What does the Talmud say about latex gloves? The four questions will be left unanswered because even the Wise Son has no idea how to â€œflatten the curve.â€ Seders the world over will feature an abundance of empty seats for Elijah, who, this year, will be wearing a mask. The Red Sea will remain at high tide. Signs and Wonders are suspended until further notice âˆ’ or until a vaccine is found. Â â€œCOVID-19 has created a blockade not seen since the British Mandate.â€ This is one heartless, joyless virus. Those most susceptible, the elderly, who the coronavirus favors most cruelly, happen to be the ones most indispensable to the seder experience. What kind of a seder leaves grandparents alone in their homes, apartments and elder-care facilities? But we canâ€™t have them anywhere near coughing children scampering for the afikomen. What alternatives are there? The new normal in seder etiquette requires an ingenuity far beyond the making of flourless cake and tiramisu for dessert. This moment requires special cleaning instructions that surpass the usual search-and-destroy mission on chametz. Weâ€™re talking Lysol tsunamis. A stray morsel of bread is of lesser significance than airborne COVID-19 droplets. Donâ€™t be surprised to see a seder guest in a HAZMAT suit. This is why people and communities are scheduling virtual seders as part of an overall mitigation strategy. Welcome to digital seders via FaceTime and Zoom. Good luck with that. It will look as though â€œThe Brady Bunchâ€ and â€œHollywood Squaresâ€ converted to Judaism. Dozing off without anyone noticing will be a challenge. Drones will be called in to uncover the afikomen. Any mention of the Ten Commandments being brought down from Mt. Sinai will cause genuine confusion for those using their own tablets. Letâ€™s face it: The liberation story of Passover is a misnomer this year. You can point to the Haggadah as precedent all you want, but it wonâ€™t lift the curfews and quarantines. We are dealing with an 11th plague without mercy. Lambsâ€™ blood on doorposts is no inoculate. The coronavirus has made its presence known in the land of our biblical ancestors. The Jewish State of Israel is under quarantine, too. Throughout its modern history and endlessly fought wars (often with those same Egyptians), never before has there been a disruption to the making of aliyah. COVID-19 has created a blockade not seen since the British Mandate. â€œNext year in Jerusalem,â€ the coda to every seder and the longing to return after a 2,000-year absence was, for Jews âˆ’ until the creation of Israel âˆ’ just wish-fulfillment that ended seders but could not put an end to our exile. This year, it might become a trending phrase among the Diaspora. American, Canadian and European Jews once believed all it took were plane tickets on El Al; for the time being, travel restrictions to Israel remain one of the cruel jokes of this Passover. Fleeing Jews have a better chance of seeing the Pyramids than the Western Wall. Slavery itself takes on new meaning in the form of mandatory stay-at-home orders. Admittedly, it is more polite bondage. There are no mud and whips, but the despair and loneliness that comes with isolation will be unabated. At least the Israelites had one another. However, no one can miss the irony: We are about to commemorate an exodus amid present-day confinement. Our movement has come to a halt. Everything about our once-frenzied, mobile lives is suspended, placed on hiatus, postponed indefinitely. Wandering Jews now are forcibly stationary. New York City subways, London tubes and LAâ€™s 405 are eerily empty. Home confinement put an end to all that gridlock. â€œWandering Jews now are forcibly stationary.â€ Momentarily overcoming his speech impediment, Moses delivered to Pharaoh what still is the most declarative ultimatum on behalf of the Jewish people: â€œLet my people go!â€ Today, our plea is far more modest and directed not to a pharaoh, but to any deity or epidemiologist willing to listen: â€œPlease, just let my people go â€¦ outside.â€ Of course, the fact the coronavirus spares no one is no reason for implacable anti-Semites not to charge Jews with having caused it. The ancient blood libel against Jews has always lacked imagination. It has surfaced throughout history as a most stubborn and adaptable urban legend, even in places where there are no Jews. Isnâ€™t the coronavirus bad enough without perpetuating absurd lies? Christian pastor Rick Wiles recently delivered a sermon scapegoating Jews as the perpetrators of a coronavirus conspiracy, all emanating from synagogues. Sound familiar? That medieval canard of disease-carrying Jews is alive and well, no matter the pandemic. How many Jews live in the Wuhan Province of China, do you figure? Meanwhile, officials from both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas publicly blamed Israel for deliberately spreading the coronavirus within the territories. Anti-Semites throughout history may have been underachievers, but they never failed to display tremendous resourcefulness in tailoring the blood libel to apply to new situations. Donâ€™t allow a global catastrophe to go to waste without pointing the finger of blame at the Jews â€” whether in the form of the bubonic plague, 9/11, financial collapse and crashes, and, of course, mysteriously â€œmissingâ€ Christian children, as if their blood actually improved the taste of matzo. Note to Jew-haters everywhere: There is no â€œkavodâ€ to having COVID-19. But all is not lost. Curiously, without a medical cure, we have been preparing for the coronavirus for decades now. The introduction of the Internet and the rise of social media fortuitously and in some cosmic way, have allowed us to be in rehearsal for this very moment. Social distancing has been in progress all along, and the distance between us has continued to expand exponentially. We never realized all this â€œstaying apart while pretending to be togetherâ€ one day would become a necessity because of a global pandemic that absolutely forbade social contact. Tragic in so many ways, COVID-19 now makes official and even tests the dramatic asocial, pseudo-social changes in our lives. The pandemic exiled everyone to the claustrophobic confines of their own homes. But we were more than ready for it. We already had outfitted our homes with the toys and tools that would fortify us for such trials in hibernation. Hopefully, this forced isolation wonâ€™t make permanent what we believed we could take back â€” if our grand experiment in distancing left us emotionally unmoored and simply too far apart physically. We knew all along that the â€œsocialâ€ part of the social network always belonged in quotations. Surely, we were never so foolish as to believe Facebook was the equal of actual socialization. Yet we perfected such efficient but empty contact with other human beings, and bought into the premises of a forever isolating, shrinking existence. The moment of truth has arrived. It is the culminating triumph of social media itself, the endgame we were lulled into adopting, the complacency of the couch potato, homebody, video-gamer, Facebook voyeur â€” all packaged into one pale, lonely face. Face-to-face contact with friends and family rapidly has been vanishing with each passing year. Hearing an actual voice was replaced by the reading of atonal texts. Along the way, we forgot that pressing the send button is no substitute for human intimacy. At least there is Siri and Alexa. We voluntarily self-quarantined so many facets of our lives, and it should serve us well during this health crisis. Gone are Sunday strolls, gym pit-stops and coffee runs.

I captured a pic of that info off of a Fox News graphic, so it sits on my cell phone as reference ongoing.In our effort to stop nasties at our door after we pickup packages and mail we deposit them just inside the doorway, write the letter of the day of the week (M, T, W, R, ...) on the front with a Sharpie, and wash hands immediately. Based upon the study Doug references, letters, cardboard boxes, ... sit for 24 hours before opening.There is some concern about plastic stuff inside the boxes, but so far we've not addressed that. Probably should. With small stuff Clorox wipes are probably the easiest, but we've been trying to conserve use since who knows how long before we'll be able to get more.Plastic envelopes either sit for 3 days, or gets Lysoled before opening. We tend to prefer the 3 days so whatever is inside also waits ... plus the flowery Lysol smell drives me crazy.I'll admit that we don't do much to clean up groceries when they come in the door besides washing hands. Most of it sits on shelves or in the fridge for a few days before we use it anyway, plus we assume it sat on a shelf at the store for a little while - possibly less than 24 hours though. We've not heard/seen if the store is using extra sanitation measures. It's a VERY small family owned store.On a VERY side and sad note, today I read about two smallish studies (n=100 & 18) that show that about 2/3's of COVID-19 patients who get put on a ventilator do not come off alive (don't survive). That sucks.With me being 60 and my wife a young 63, we're taking this very seriously and doing our best to avoid the virus until a vaccine is available.

If these "journalists" had done an ounce of research instead of pushing their fear mongering propaganda, they would have known that these animals do get Corona virus and that knowledge has been known for years. There bodies handle it differently and they often don't exhibit any symptoms at all. The Corona virus has been around for a long time. There are constantly changing strains just like the flu. Don't believe that, look at the label of your Lysol spray can at the things lysol kills. It's been on the label for years. The "lion whisperer" did a video talking about it in big cats last week but our "journalist" feed it to the public as "breaking news"! It's rediculous.

Here are a few tips to keep in mind and to help you keep that money in your bank account and out of the hands of cybercriminals: The check will only be delivered via your mailing address or the bank account listed on your 2018-2019 tax return The government does not need your social security number (SSN), date of birth (DOB), driverâ€™s license (DL) number, home address, credit card or bank account information to send you the check This payment is yours in full. There is no processing fee. Anyone who is asking for pre-payment in order to process the check is a fraudster There is no expedited payment option. Some fraudsters, and even disgruntled businesses, may contact you with an offer for expedited payment. That is nothing but an advanced loan, just like the one you can get from the IRS if you owe them money on your tax return. Donâ€™t fall for it. You will get your money on time. The IRS will not contact you about this payment (phone, email or text) Remember, your SSN, DOB, DL, and address are probably on the dark web already. Fraudsters can be very persuasive and authentic-seeming with that information in their hands. Be sure to double-check all links and email addresses before clicking on anything. I will keep you updated on any new developments, but this is a big one and thereâ€™s no room for slip-ups. Thereâ€™s a lot at stake for cybercriminals and you will more than likely be a target, so stay cautious and safe. Always remember, think before you click.
I'm surprised Trump hasn't told people that you can protect yourself from Coronavirus by sucking on a Lysol wipe
Imagine if you will... Commercials in 2030 will be like; Were you or someone you know overly exposed to hand sanitizer, Lysol,or bleach during the Covid 19 pandemic? If so, you may be eligible for compensation...
In Ohio where we just keep saying "Here, hold my beer..." Schools shut down since early March. Stay at home order started two weeks ago, now extended through the end of April. Essential businesses only open. Lots of arguing about what is essential. Effective tomorrow, all businesses must now limit the number of people in them. Restaurants are carry out, drive thru or delivery only. Our town has done a Facebook page to help the local ones keep open by posting specials, menus or just for the reminder that they are still open Working from home as my job is considered essential. SNAP/TANF/ Medicaid must be processed and with our agency if one of us caught it we would not only spread it to everyone in our unit, but to children services and child support as we share a building. We have also been told that we can switched to working just for our partner counties but may have to pitch in for other counties in the state if they start to have problems with their workers and the virus. We have also been told that we may have to help out with unemployment because it is a clusterf**k. The system is over burdened because it was never meant to have 200,000 people apply in one shot. Overall, there is no TP in the county to be had unless you are the first person in the store in the morning. I scored some Lysol over the weekend. I'm not looking for food because I tend to be overstocked as it is. Just need perishables weekly. We have several small town butcher shops in my county so we have had access to meat, you just need to look for it and maybe pay a little bit more then you planned. Ohio has been leading the charge in lots of different things. We shut down mass gatherings before we had a reason to which has helped us keep our numbers lower than some of our surrounding states.

The only issue is how many of the strong are inadvertently taking down by the errant sneeze, Anyway, we stay at home, wear masks on the outside irrespective of a lacking president's words, we create those tight circles of the trusted who follow protocol, and we do not go to work in unsafe environments.

Comment Anchor Comments Tip Jar I hate to say it, but, she ended up being the classic Darwin Award winner. However stupid she was, i would prefer that she still be alive and complaining. The current circumstances we are undergoing, this virus, or, any virus, doesn't know anything about religion, political ideology, wealth, sex, color or nationality. The virus attacks members of the human race, which is the only race on this planet. I hesitate to say that you should protect yourself, because, the people who have arsenals in this country, will probably go on a shooting spree out of fear and paranoia, thus adding to the problem. Hell of a world. Ride it out and i'll see you on the other side. She won't be able to collect her Darwin Award now. John Lennon wrote a song that's apropro: Thanks for the much needed chuckle. i adore karma, especially when it is this rich and creamy. I don't like to think this way, but if these people want to be ignorant I'm not going to mourn their passing. I just hope the idiot didn't spread it to anyone else, although that is doubtful. The coronavirus is no respecter of persons. It has fallen : on Capt. Crozier and on Boris Johnson, and equally without distinction, sometimes fatally -- e.g., on Dr. Li Wenliang, and on this woman. And potentially, any one of us. No guarantees. While it's unfortunate and harmful to eschew protective measures, IMO comments about â€œnatural selectionâ€ in this context are short-sighted and in poor taste.

People are changing their hand washing, laundry, and eating habits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the fear of getting sick by eating contaminated food has led to some questionable cleaning practices, such washing produce with soap or diluted chlorine. Some people even reportedly spray their food with Lysol. "Do not do that," warns Benjamin Chapman, Ph.D., food safety expert at North Carolina State University. According to its manufacturer, Lysol isn't meant to be ingested, and doing so could make you really sick, says Chapman. However, cleaning your fruits and vegetables is almost as important as eating them. Harmful bacteria like E. coli, Salmonella, and Norovirus can live on foods, especially lettuce, sprouts, and melon. The novel coronavirus doesn't change the rules of washing produce, says Chapman. First, there's no evidence that you can contract COVID-19 from food. And second, experts recommend following the same food safety practices for COVID-19 as you normally would, he explains. Here's the right way to wash away dirt, bacteria, and pesticides. Start with clean hands and surfacesRinsing your produce is pointless if your hands, utensils, or cutting boards are dirty. The Food & Drug Administration recommends washing your hands with soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after touching food. You should wash all kitchen supplies, such as knives and colanders, with hot soapy water after every use to avoid cross-contamination. Be sure to dry hands using a clean towel, says Donald Schaffner, Ph.D., a food safety expert at Rutgers University. The ick factor of your towel depends on a variety of factors. For example, a cloth that does double duty to dry counters is likely dirtier than one dedicated to clean hands. And you'll want to use paper towels to wipe hands after handling meat, he says. Schaffner suggests changing cloth towels every two to three days. Wash produce just before eatingSimilarly to meal prepping, pre-washing a container of berries so they're ready for weekday snacking is a smart strategy, right? Not according to Chapman. "It [washing] removes some of the protection that the plant has against mold and yeast to prevent spoilage," he says. Fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicals, harmless bacteria, and oil that prevent mold and yeast from growing, Chapman explains. Just use waterJust to reiterate: Using chlorine or other chemical cleaners is dangerous. Soap is less problematic but its residue may stick to your fooddespite thorough washing. "If you ingest soap it can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea," says Schaffner. Your best bet is to rinse produce under cold water for as long as you're patientthere is no recommended length of time, says Chapman. Water alone removes about 99 percent of dirt and possible contaminants, so there's no need for vinegar or store-bought produce solutions. "We cant do any better than that in our homes," says Chapman. Some people soak their leafy greens, but the practice could increase your risk of foodborne illness, according to Chapman. "If I soak lettuce, and I have one leaf that has contamination on itand I don't rinse wellthen I have multiple leaves that could be contaminated," he says. Know when to scrubStudies show that friction produced when drying your hands on paper towel removes additional bacteria, and the same is likely true for produce, says Schaffner. Firm foods, like cucumbers, should be scrubbed using a clean brush, according to the FDA. And melons, particularly cantaloupe, should always be scrubbed prior to rinsing, says Chapman. "That netting [on cantaloupe] can definitely hide pathogens," he explains. Break out the brush when eating raw foods grown directly on the groundas long as they can withstand a good rub. Bottom line Washing produce can prevent some pretty harmful bacteria from getting inside your body,but there's no need to be overzealous about your technique.

So, assault an employee with Lysol. COMPLETE THE SHOPPING TRANSACTION AND LEAVE IN AN UBER. How the fuck was the nog not detained until cops showed up?
Spray your coat with Lysol too. I'm keeping my coat separately from the rest of the clothes.
Stayed home 13 days and went out today to shop, with my mask, sunglasses, and gloves, armed with lysol, hand wash, alcohol spray. Only seen 2 people total in 4 stores with a scarf over their face. Ontario has the 2nd highest # of ppl w covid-19. I thought more took it seriously.

Corona virus is written on a Lysol cans, has been for how many years. Soo, lets move to cancer. We spend billions on cancer treatment, how many people know what causes cancer? What prevents cancer? How do you protect yourself 100% from getting cancer? Ok we know cell mutations. But why???

Tuesday Tip! The COVID-19 virus can live on a surface from 4 to 9 days. Make sure to use alcohol, Lysol, bleach, or any home disinfectant on a regular basis to clean objects you might forget about - car keys, door handles, cellphones, or keyboards, to name a few! #Covid #Covid19

Walmart patron sprays cashier in the eyes with Lysol over coronavirus limit, police say Police in Massachusetts are searching for a woman who they say sprayed a Walmart employee in the eyes with Lysol disinfectant. Leicester police said in a Facebook post-Monday that the unidentified woman sprayed the worker after being informed there was a limit on the number of cans she could buy. The department says the incident took place at the town???s Walmart on March 27. Police say the woman completed her purchase after spraying the employee and then left in an Uber. They say EMS also responded to the scene to treat the worker. The department posted an image of the suspect and urged anyone with information to call or email officers. Walmart and other stores have limited the number of Lysol products and other basic cleaning supplies people can purchase because of high demand during the coronavirus pandemic. https://tinyurl.com/rzjr6ys

Well they hate the American way the right loves it anyway. Trump seemed to be way ahead of this but the media was too busy trying to impeach him. I think our Governor still is. If they were not so focused they might have helped the public get out of ahead of it as well. I spend tonight shopping for bandana's so I have a face covering, of course not the recommended one but I think it is going to be mandatory and we still need to go out once a week for groceries. It was hard to even find them in stock, let alone masks or sanitizer, lysol or anything else related to this. I suspect the general population and workers still working are screwed when it comes to these as they all are going to hospitals and such.

Yes, coronavirus is listed on old Lysol bottles or Clorox wipes; "some people assume it will prevent the spread of this yearâ€™s new coronavirus, which is yet unnamed" Unnamed? Then what's that covid19 name they keep throwing around?

#Twisdom #COVID19 #Cleaningtips RT @newyorknewart: Hand sanitizer is meant to lower how much of the infection is on your hands "without stripping your skin of all its oils and moisture," Graham said. "Surface disinfectants â€” like Lysol, bleach â€” are better for surfaces."

@_BoobieJohnson Boy you donâ€™t know. Lmao that shit been in America for who knows how long. Also Coronavirus has been around for years COVID-19 is the mutated version. Check ya Lysol can
@_BoobieJohnson Coronavirus is a common flu. COVID-19 is the fucked up cousin. That shit been on Clorox / Lysol products for YEARS
@alexiajewel88 The term coronavirus is a blanket term for several illnesses thats why you can see it on Lysol bottles etc and to me it makes sense that an illness would spread in a highly populated area like NYC. Idk the 5g standpoint just doesnâ€™t make complete sense to me
@AllenWest @DrNealHouston Right. I agree Like why are they just calling it coronavirus now, which includes the common cold, the flu, and was written on the back of Lysol cans 20 years ago, instead of #COVID19? *These people are sick*
@Angel Brumfiled I had my groceries delivered from the market, let them sit for a while and then wet a rag with lysol cleaner and wiped everything off before putting my items away and that included refrigerator and freezer foods as well as all canned and packaged foods.
@BradBeaven @nikitos1979hmm @benshapiro Calm down dummy. I see you still have nothing but emotion supporting your narrative. 98% survival rate and 95% cases have mild symptoms. You do know itâ€™s just a new strain? Coronavirus been around since 8,000BC. Wikipedia it. Back of Lysol cans have listed it for years. Dummy
@daverichard Any plans for a COVID-19 trade value chart? I need to know how many bottles of hand sanitizer I would need to trade for a can of Lysol spray. Please help! @JunksRadio

 @Lysol Here we are WEEKS into this #Pandemic, yet the TWO biggest sellers in the world #Walmart #Amazon are out, what the hell? Ironic, that two of the biggest things to save us from #coronavirus "Hand sanitizer" and "Lysol" can't be found ðŸ™„ Thanks for being there for us!
@ShannonSharpe The US government knew well in advance about COVID-19 and they allowed all those infected travelers to come here. Owners of lysol and paper towel companies are laughing all the way to their swiss banks. Forced vaccinations will be next to come.
@White2to4 @HSVreport There are many Coronaviruses. They have a shot for it at the vets office. Itâ€™s on the back of a Lysol can! Itâ€™s known as The Common Cold! COVID-19 was created by using the common cold and added nasty stuff to it. ITS A BIOWEAPON! It was created in a Wuhan Lab!

A sleep expert explains why you're having such vivid dreams during the coronavirus pandemic There have been a bunch of articles about people having more vivid dreams during this pandemic, especially people in isolation and lockdown. Wondering if anyone has dreams they would like to share. People have reported they're having especially vivid dreams since the coronavirus pandemic forced them to stay mostly, if not entirely, at home. A sleep expert told Insider the phenomenon could be due to the fact that there's a lot more information and emotions our brains are trying to process during sleep. More vivid or memorable dreams could also be related to people's altered sleep schedules, which may allow for more REM sleep, or the period when dreams occur. The article is from inside.com and starts here- The other night I gave birth to a loaf of pumpernickel bread. Later, I raced through a strip mall on a time-sensitive mission but was interrupted at a shoe store where the cashier was holding patrons hostage in an ice-breaker game. Finally, I resumed my senior year of college, where I poured milk over the side of my sorority-house bunk bed and watched it turn into a psychedelic potion. Then, I woke up. Over the past month, my real life has become sensorially monotonous due to coronavirus-related "stay-at-home" orders in what's usually the city that never sleeps. Where I used to run over and under New York City bridges and through boroughs just to get to work, I now roll over and log on. Where I used to wake to the smell of our neighborhoods' bakery and barbecue joints, I now smell Lysol. And, where I used to hear car horns beeping, I now hear my microwave. Â  But these days my dream life, though always colorful, is particularly grand. I talked to others who've had similar experiences and a sleep expert to figure out why. Many people are reporting deep vivid, memorable, and super realistic dreams When I recruited Facebook friends to tell me about their current experiences with dreams, over 20 responded overnight using words like "vivid," "realistic," and "memorable." "I'm sleeping deeply and having the kinds of dreams I used to have as a kid Â— super detailed with real plots I can actually recall and recount, instead of just generalized weirdness," one friend said. Another person said she had such a vivid dream one night she told her family. "The majority of them shared their oddly vivid dreams from the same night," she said. One person said she never dreams, but that all changed in the past two weeks. Another confessed her "dreams are so real I think they've actually happened." While some people recalled coronavirus-related or otherwise stressful dreams, others said they welcomed the escape. "I look forward to my nightly adventures," a fellow New Yorker told me. Another echoed the sentiment: During one recent dream, she was at an upscale outdoor bar with friends from work, "having fun and socializing," she remembers. "It was nice." A sleep expert told me the dreams may be helping us process information and emotions Michael Grandner, director of the University of Arizona's sleep and health research program, told me two factors are likely at play. The first has to do with the brain's role in learning, emotion processing, and memory formation. "Dreams are our brains' processing and organizing and integrating and making sense of things," he said, and we're all trying to make sense of the world right now. "We're dumped in this new environment and we're trying to figure out our place in it." Whether that processing leads to enjoyable dreams or panic-ridden ones may have something to do with how much media coverage you've watched and whether you've managed your anxiety in other ways, like by talking to family and friends, a study on college students' dreams after 9/11 suggests. Another key issue at play could be changing schedules: Many people are sleeping later these days, Grandner finds, since the normal life logistics of preparing for and getting to work and school no longer take up time. "They're sleeping like a retired person," Grandner said. That's not a bad thing: The extra time, particularly in the morning, may allow your brain to complete another REM cycle or two, the type of deep sleep during which most vivid dreams occur. "Before, we stopped the movie before we got to the interesting part," Grandner said. "Now, we might not be doing that." Eventually, he suspects, these midnight showings may become less frequent or exciting as our bodies catch up and adjust. Right now, they're "rebound" dreams. "It's like when you've been holding your breath for a while," he said, "those first few breaths are good ones." Source: https://www.insider.com/why-are-my-d...ockdown-2020-4

Because of COVID-19, we are suddenly a people who can not clean our homes enough; here's how to do it effectively but safely. For years I have been dedicated to DIY cleaners and/or the greenest, gentlest household products I can find â€“ for both for personal and environmental health. Suddenly, enter the new coronavirus, and I'm thinking, "quick, drench the house in industrial chlorine bleach." But I know there's a better way. I realize I need more than my favorite DIY baking soda cleaner, but what things can I use to destroy the coronavirus that don't come with their own set of concerns? With that in mind, I wrote about common household products that can destroy the coronavirus, all of which I recommend. But for anyone wanting a commercial product, there are plenty. Both the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemistry Council have lists ( here and here ) of products that do one of two things. Each product either complies with the EPAâ€™s emerging viral pathogen guidance, with demonstrated efficacy against viruses harder to kill than SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), or have demonstrated efficacy against another human coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2. There are hundreds of products between the two lists, and wading through the details and chemical names is not for the faint of heart. But consumer health organization Environmental Working Group (EWG) used their Guide to Healthy Cleaning as a tool to assess products for ingredients that may affect human or environmental health. (See the EWG methodology here.) They arrived at a list of 16 products that earned grades of A or B, indicating "lowest concern" or "low concern." Here they are: Safe products for disinfectingClorox Commercial Solutions Disinfecting Bio Stain & Odor Remover Clorox Pet Solutions Advanced Disinfecting Stain & Odor Remover Lysol Hydrogen Peroxide Action Multi-Purpose Cleaner, Oxygen Splash Lysol Hydrogen Peroxide Bathroom Cleaner, Cool Spring Breeze Lysol Hydrogen Peroxide Multi-Purpose Cleaner, Citrus Sparkle Zest Lysol Hydrogen Peroxide Multi-Purpose Cleaning Wipes, Oxygen Splash Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Island Breeze Purell Multi Surface Disinfectant, Fragrance Free Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray, Eucalyptus, Spearmint & Thyme Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray, Fresh Citrus & Thyme Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray, Lavender Vanilla & Thyme Seventh Generation Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner, Lemongrass Citrus Scent Seventh Generation Disinfecting Multi-Surface Cleaner, Lemongrass Citrus Scent Seventh Generation Disinfecting Wipes, Lemongrass Citrus Scent Windex Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner Windex Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner, Glade Rainshower Safer active ingredientsIf you can not find any of the products listed above, EWG recommends checking the labels of EPA-registered products for the following active ingredients, which are safer and lower in toxicity compared to others: Hydrogen peroxide Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) Citric acid L-lactic acid Caprylic acid (octanoic acid) Thymol Active ingredients to avoidWhen considering a product, read the labels and be on the lookout for these ingredients that may be best to avoid. Sodium hypochlorite : EWG notes that this is "linked to harm to the skin and respiratory system and the environment. When improperly mixed with other cleaners or acids, sodium hypochlorite can be fatally poisonous." It is also found in chlorine bleach. Quaternary ammonium compounds : Also known as quats, which, according to EWG, are linked to asthma and suspected of causing reproductive toxicity and birth defects in humans. They also take an environmental toll. Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar mixed together : the combination forms caustic peracetic acid. Tips for healthy cleaning1. Read the instructions carefully, and follow them. 2. Wear gloves or other safety gear if recommended. 3. Open windows, open doors, ventilate while cleaning. 4. Do not mix products together. 5. Disinfectants do not work well on dirty or greasy surfaces, so wash with soap and water first. To learn about safe products, visit EWG.

Corona virus is everywhere. Itâ€™s why the lysol can says it kills it. CoviD 19 is a specific strain which is why people have stopped saying corona. Corona is everywhere .. Covid 19 is not but still spreading. As I understand it (and I really donâ€™t) if an animal or living organism has the same or similar protein receptors to us it can bind to them spread and infect.

Every time I spray Lysol, I think I inhale half of it â€“ is it killing the airborne #coronavirus that may be entering my lungs at the same time? Why aren't we huffing #Lysol? Or shooting up #Purell? I think those are fair questions. Anyone? #covid19 #CoronavirusUSA #virus
Fascinating to watch young parents who once preached on Instagram about the need to use safe, green cleaning supplies around their kids. Now they are sharing #COVID19 videos where they just straight-up Lysol their kids' hands and mouths every five minutes.
Find out when Lysol first listed "Human Coronavirus" on its label and you'll know. Ask any vet how long they've been administering Bovine Coronavirus vaccine and you'll have some idea. This is NOTHING NEW! A lot of people have known about it long before Trump ran for POTUS..... RT @Mcphie00: Dr. Fauci said today on the National News, "The Coronavirus isn't going away; it will be an ongoing part of life from now on". Does that sound like there is a plan to use the Coronavirus to subdue the American People?

Have yâ€™all ever paid attn to the Lysol disinfectant spray/Colorox wipes. It says it kills all germs including human coronavirus but from what Iâ€™m hearing on the tv this virus has never been identified in a human until now so how would they know if they wasnâ€™t the 1 to create it.

Hola my friends. I am writing you from Guayaquil, Ecuador, the hardest hit city for covid19 in Ecuador. I will just share with you my personal experience and a day in the life....... Today, Sunday 5th of April a goverment spokesman says the total population with covid19 in Ecuador is 3,646, dead 180. Guayas Province is the one with the most cases with 2,524, the second hardest hit province is Pichincha where the capital, Quito, is situated with 345. As you see the difference is huge. A little personal background here. I returned from a trip to California in the middle of Feb and started packing for my move to a new home besides all the paperwork with selling and buying a new property, and fixing the new place with lots of workers coming and going. no time for outside news I really lived in a bubble. I had disconnected cable tv and went in the internet sporadically as at night I was beat . So I did hear a little about covid19 but did not paid it that much attention. Thursday 12 March I started to hear a little bit more , but I was I in the middle of my move, with a moving company and 6 people packing my home. Social Isolation was imposible ! This continue Friday and then on Sunday March 15 we heard that there were going to be very strict measurements to combat this covid19 specially in the city of Guayaquil starting on Wednesday the 18 th. My move continued and Tuesday 17th at 6pm everybody left and I was left with a dirty apt, full of boxes, all paintings still packed. I spent the next 10 days unpacking , cleaning, disinfecting , cleaning, disinfecting again and again. More than 10 people between strangers and some people work for me had been in very close quarters with me for close to a week. No social distancing at all, besides being in the group of over sixty years old and being a diabetic......I started to worry.. Some of the measurements the government took was to put a curfew in place for all the country from 4 pm to 5 am at the beginning , then it was shorten from 2pm to 5 am NO private cars allowed. No inter-provincial traffic allowed. All stores closed, BUT supermarkets and pharmacies open. The companies or businesses relating to food production and medicine are still working. Nothing else. Then they put a restriction to our driving. You could go out depending on your last tag number, mine being 2 I was allowed to drive Tuesday and Saturday. Then this coming week it has been changed to once a week. My day is Monday which means tomorrow I will be in line outside the supermarket at 7 am ( opens at 8) and surely I will be number 70 in line as I was this past Friday. Everybody wearing a mask and gloves , more than 6 feet apart. the line at that hour moves fast and inside the supermarket you find almost anything you need. Maybe lysol type products are not found , but plenty of toilet paper( what is the deal ?) and food. That will be the only day I could go out of my house. In the urbanization I live you cannot even exercise or walk on the public places. Very strict. Restaurants are closed, but they can deliver. Uber eats and all similar business doing good. Airports are close since 2 weeks ago ,no domestic or International flights allowed, just some humanitarians flights taking USA nationals back to the states, there is one this Tuesday from Guayaquil. tickets one way are $1,000. Also today I know there is another humanitarian flight from Great Britain bringing 90 underage students that were in Oxford learning or perfecting their English language and have been stuck there for close to 3 weeks. The plane if arriving in Quito and everybody had to pay a hotel in Quito to quarantine for 15 days. All this brings me to how I think Guayas, my city Guayaquil and my neighborhood specially got so many cases of covid19. This is our summer in this part of the country. Heat and rain. No classes. Quito , in the Andes mountains has the same summer vacation as USA OR Europe. This is the time for school vacations with your family and lots of people travel to USA or Europe. Also, colleges an d universities are cheaper in Europe than USA and lots of kids study there. When problems started in Europe, and classes were cancelled, then Ecuadoreans kids returned home. The first ones did not quarantined and passed the virus. since then , things have changed, but the damage was done. Paciente Zero here was not from Guayas, but from another province and she passed it to her family. Ecuador being a third world country is poor and was not prepared for this epidemic. Who was ? Look at Italy, Spain, Usa........we are doing the best we can , but yes, hospitals are full, the only free beds are if somebody dies a doctor was telling me a few days ago. Number of deaths are higher than the official numbers, but cases in my zone have start to stabilize. I really do not know if it is true they are burning corpses in the streets. I saw a video of what looked like a corpse in the streets with a sheet covering it and a lady went to remove the cover and the man. jump at her ! There is a lot of fake news around , promoted by the opposition to this goverment. Please do not ask me for charts or articles that I have read. I do not know how to include them here. this is just my personal experience I wanted to share. So we continue , this is my third week or 19th day in my apartment. I am lucky it is big , has a beautiful view, I have money to pay for my food. Very worried about the consequences that are going to happened , the social upheaval that can result from this when people cannot work. I Have friends with the virus, some in hospitals in USA or here in Ecuador , in ventilators. I had people I know died. Also some family members got the virus, but in a mild form. I also have friends that are giving their plasma because they are cured . The people that have died had died alone THAT is all for now. As always excuse my English. Please take care. I have not read anything in the forum about the virus, my internet is not that good. Will do so now. bye ahhhh had to finish by saying our Vice President is great. Just saw Bill has the latest from him . .
I f*cking love Walmart https://www.tacticalshit.com/walmart-patron-sprays-cashier-in-the-eyes-with-lysol-over-coronavirus-limit/
I feel like Danny Tanner. I just used a Lysol wipe to wipe down the Lysol wipes container. #COVID19
I have an idea. Madea and covid 19 movie. Madea is an Uber driver spraying folks with Lysol when getting in the back of the car. And keeping folks away 6 ft with her cane. Lol you gotta do it
I have to say though Iâ€™m just not eating out right now. And when I do bring stuff in the house. I Lysol wipe everything up and then wash my hands. I was able to get some of those wipes so I am using them.
I hope they find this loser quickly. Before she starts serving her time in jail, they should let the cashier spray her in the face a few times. https://www.pennlive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/woman-sprays-walmart-cashier-in-eyes-with-lysol-disinfectant-after-being-told-there-was-limit-on-number-of-cans-she-could-buy-police.html
I just looked at my thing of Lysol wipes and it says it kills the human coronavirus.
I just saw two ten-year-old boys on Razor scooters chasing each other while wearing masks and spraying Lysol in a McDonaldâ€™s parking lot. #COVID19
I really hope you donâ€™t actually eat food after spraying it with Lysol... â€œcoronavirus â€œ is in the ingredients....
I thought niggers were using jenkem tuh fights off dat ol' coonaroma buyruss. Lysol is for Humans.
I understand there's a lot of anxiety right now and people are stressed, but it is NOT OK to lash out. Period. https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/massachusetts-woman-sprays-walmart-cashier-eyes-lysol/67-58491d69-a52c-40f2-a055-4070068bad03 #KHOU11 #HTownRush
I understood shelves being bare the first week or two of this #coronavirus gig. But now I believe companies like @Lysol and @scottproducts are deliberately not sending stock to stores to create a false shortage and more panic. I believe the @FTC needs to get involved.
Iâ€™m no conspiracy theorist, but for the life of me I canâ€™t understand why Lysol & hand sanitizer has yet to be restocked. Those seem like essential jobs to me, especially since the Lysol can says it kills human Coronavirus on it..but hey, here we are week/day whatever & no Lysol
Iâ€™m sick and tired of not being able to buy Lysol spray, disinfectant wipes, or hand sanitizer
If coronavirus is in your home to begin with, put down the Lysol wipes because you already have it

It's all fun and games until he returns from the store with no diapers and a three-pound brick of butter. A strict quarantine is a good way to learn about your partner, and what Sara Hudson has learned is that her husband, Daniel, the Nationalsâ€™ closer, does not know how to use a Lysol wipe. â€œYou have to do it for a good 20 seconds for it to work!â€ Sara says. Daniel tends to give the contents of a grocery bag one pass and then put them away. In Saraâ€™s view, he might as well just walk the food through a hospitalâ€™s isolation ward before serving it to their three daughters. She laughs and says, â€œIâ€™m just like, â€˜Iâ€™ll do it.â€™ â€ As the coronavirus pandemic has spread across the globe, and the MLB season has been suspended, players are home, waiting out this uneasy period like the rest of us. Unlike the record 6.6 million Americans who filed for unemployment during the week ending March 28, many of these players enjoy a financial cushion. They do not draw paychecks until the season begins, but the average major leaguer made $4.36 million last year, according to the Associated Press. Still, they are frightened and unsettled. They are struggling to establish some sense of normalcy during the least normal stage of their lives. Some of them are also driving their wives crazy. It's a small aggravation, nothing compared with the real devastation that the virus has caused. Ali Mahtook tries to find the humor in it. Her husband, Mikie, is a Phillies outfielder. He canâ€™t go to work, but she still does, as a liquor representative for bars and restaurants in Baton Rouge. As many of those businesses have closed, her company has redeployed resources toward retailâ€”meaning that while everyone around her is socially distancing, Ali is at local supermarkets and convenience stores, stocking shelves. When she gets home, she has emails to answer and data to enter. Baseball players are used to having their schedule designed for them. So after Mikie spends the morning exercising, he turns to Ali. â€œWe were laughing the other morning,â€ she says. â€œI was doing work and he was like, â€˜Iâ€™m bored! I donâ€™t know what to do!â€™â€ They got married in January, so she usually hands him a stack of cards and tells him to work on the thank-you notes. Players meticulously follow routine. So do their families. Now thatâ€™s all been upended. Tori Murphyâ€™s husband, Rockies first baseman Daniel, is eager to use this time to contribute to the household. How is that going? â€œDaniel is a very good baseball player,â€ Tori says. He recently volunteered to go grocery shopping where they live in Jacksonville. Daniel returned with an air of pride and a three-pound brick of butter. â€œI was like, â€˜Where did you find that?â€™â€ she says. â€œWe have to hack at it with a straight-up butcher knife.â€ Daniel has since been given his unconditional release from grocery shopping. Tori filled his roster spot with Instacart. Caitlin Hill can barely even discuss grocery shopping, because it reminds her of better times, before she and her husband, Twins lefty Rich, were trapped in their Milton, Mass., house with their eight-year-old son, Brice. â€œI used to be able to say, â€˜Go to Costco!â€™â€ Caitlin laments. â€œIf [Rich] was on my nerves, Iâ€™d say, â€˜O.K., go to Costco and get all these things I donâ€™t needâ€™ and that would entertain him. Now I canâ€™t send him to Costco.â€ She pauses to reminisce. Usually she would ask him to buy staple items, but once he arrived, Rich would fall under the Costco spell. â€œHeâ€™d come home with a pallet of pineapples,â€ Caitlin says. â€œWe had a watermelon once that we named, it was so big. We never cut it up. We called it Waldo.â€ Instead of making, ahem, fruitless trips to the store, ballplayers are forced to reckon with an unfamiliar existence. Playing professional baseball is a privilege, but it is also an all-consuming daily grind. What happens when that disappears? Whitney Blevins tries to be patient as her husband, 13-year veteran lefty Jerry, adjusts to life without baseball. (He was in Giants camp before spring training evaporated; San Francisco released him last week.) Of course, he knew she took care of their two boys, 23-month-old Ellis and five-month-old Ascher, but now he sees how challenging that really is. At 4 p.m. on the first full day after spring training had been canceled, he turned to her and said, â€œThis is exhausting!â€ After a few days of nonstop wrangling their six-year-old, four-year-old and two-year-old, Daniel Murphy told Tori, â€œIâ€™d rather face Clayton Kershaw every day.â€ Ellen Kershawâ€™s husband would surely rather face Murphy, too. The Dodgers ace famously clings to his baseball rituals, scheduling his day down to the second. Now he is in charge of after-school activities for his five-year-old Cali and three-year-old Charley while four-month-old Cooper naps. Claytonâ€™s home gym was designed to match the one at Dodger Stadium, and he spends three hours there each morning. Much to Ellenâ€™s relief, he has not yet conscripted her as a training partner. Every day for a week, Taylor Poppen played long toss with her husband, Sean, who is trying to crack the Twinsâ€™ rotation. Brittany Panik rolls grounders for her husband, Blue Jays second baseman Joe. Caroline Means, who played goalie for three years in the NWSL, serves as catcher for her husband, Orioles All-Star lefty John. McKenzie Marcinek climbs on the back of her fiancÃ©, Dodgers righty Walker Buehler, while he does squats. The spouses also serve as therapists. Taylor and Sean Poppen are in Atlanta under a stay-at-home order. They live in a townhome without a yard or weights. They watch on Instagram as veteran players work out in their home gyms, and Taylor reassures Sean that his talent will prevail. In the meantime he does kettlebell swings. Their six-month-old, Brady, is the kettlebell. â€œHeâ€™s, like, 24 pounds,â€ says Taylor. â€œWe have a pork chop.â€ View the original article to see embedded media. Courtesy of Taylor Poppen A few days ago, Sara Hudson felt Danielâ€™s mood dipping. There are plenty of people in Phoenix who would be happy to play catch with a reigning World Series champion, but heâ€™s afraid to share a ball. So he stands alone in a grassy area near their house, hurling baseballs through the air. Then he walks to where they have landed and throws them back. Sara cued up Game 7 of the World Series. â€œHold onto that feeling a little while longer,â€ she told him. Most of the complaints come with a wink and a laugh; they all know how fortunate they are. Kourtney Turner says, â€œI think youâ€™d be hard-pressed to find someone who feels bad for a baseball couple right now.â€ She and her husband, Dodgers All-Star third baseman Justin, spend most days on the phone for their Justin Turner Foundation. Once the schools closed, many children lost access to free and reduced-price meals; the JTF has paid L.A. restaurants, also under stress right now, to cater meals for pickup. The pain of the pandemic has directly touched baseball families, too. Janelise Maldonado and her husband, Astros catcher MartÃ­n, live in Puerto Rico in the offseason but decided to ride out the quarantine in Houston for fear they would be unable to leave the island when the season started. This has left them 2,000 miles from the people they love most. The Meanses live just a few minutes from Johnâ€™s parents, but his father has pancreatic cancer, so they cannot be near him, even if the social-distancing regulations ease. They all express concern for the families of minor leaguers, who have to make do on a few hundred dollars a month. Even for the lucky ones, there can be an emotional cost. They are unable to share milestones with loved ones. Buehler had intended to propose to Marcinek in Palm Springs, Calif., on the way from spring training to Opening Day. Instead they drove home to Kentucky. He got down on one knee in the bedroom closet. They celebrated with friends and family over FaceTime. Mostly, baseball couples try to maintain some sense of normalcyâ€”and try not to strangle one another. â€œThe wineâ€™s open by 5,â€ says Sara Hudson. Taylor and Sean Poppen work on their separate hobbies (calligraphy for her, coding for him) to give each other a break. After especially long days, Tori and Daniel Murphy fist-bump and watch TV in separate rooms. Eireann Dolan and her husband, Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle, have no such luxury. They booked a 300-square-foot room in a Homewood Suites for spring training and decided to stay there rather than go home to Chicago. Then the baseball facility was converted into a COVID-19 testing facility. Now they walk their two dogs so often that the poor creatures all but cower when the leashes come out. Sean recently had to carry their 50-pound mixed breed half a mile home after she gave up. They have watched the entire Martin Scorsese catalog and read what feels like every book ever written. Eireann has cut Seanâ€™s hair. They have had enough. Still, there are small moments of beauty, especially for the fathers. The travel inherent in their jobs means that the players can sometimes feel removed from the grind of parenting; if you see your kids for only a few hours a day, a few days a week, do you want to spend that time disciplining them? But now they are there for everything. Rich Hill has begun to enforce bedtime. Heather Zimmerman is seven months pregnant; her husband, Nationals first baseman Ryan, has begun to learn what to make their two daughters for lunch. And two weeks ago, Ascher Blevins learned to roll over. On Tuesday, he began crawling. The Giants were supposed to be on a season-opening road trip right now. Jerry might have missed all that. Dolan does not see how MLB can possibly return in 2020. There are too many people, too many possible chances for infection. â€œShort of imprisoning them in a stadiumâ€”â€ she starts. A commotion in the background interrupts her. Doolittle has been listening inâ€”itâ€™s hard not to, from a few feet awayâ€”and has something to add. â€œTell her we want to play!â€ he insists. She laughs. â€œBelieve me,â€ she says, â€œI want you out of the house, too.â€
Ive been having those Clorox & Lysol Wipes wayyyy before #COVID19 ! U didnâ€™t know I NEVER enjoyed being coughed and Sneezed on SO Every time I flew on any Airline I had on a #MASK and wiped down the Seats, Trays, Overhead Storage & the Air Vents! Slept w my Coat over my head! ðŸ˜‚
Just curious how everyone prepared when they leave the house for shopping, etc. I bring lysol wipes to wipe down the grocery cart. No gloves. I also don't wear a facemask but I feel like I probably should. At this point though, can you even buy them?

Just curious...anyone care to share a prediction of how quickly anti-vaxers change their opinions once a vaccine for COVID-19 is available? I personally think theyâ€™ll be lined up as quickly as they changed from homemade cleaning products and green chemicals to Clorox & Lysol.

No, it's not the Apocalypse. Not yet, anyway. Let's hope it stays that way. I'm not even sure you can have an Apocalypse without zombies. But ... Lysol. Or anybrand of disinfecting spray or wipes. Who knew ordinary household cleaning products would ever become such a hot commodity? You cannotget disinfectant products anywhere. Not for love, not for money, not even for your firstborn. I didn't even think about buying this stuff until early March when the threat of Coronavirus suddenly became real. By that time, the store shelves were already empty of these kinds of items. I had on hand exactly half a can of Lysol spray, and that was it. I eventually found a can of disinfecting wipes at a dollar store and one at the grocery store. I figured no big deal, you can get these things online any day of the week. Wrong! Not one major retailer had anything left in stock. Neither did vendors I'd never heard of. I did finally manage to get some supplies from eBay and Amazon -- hand sanitizer, alcohol wipes, a can of off-brand disinfectant spray (which feels about half full), antibacterial hand soap, and a small bottle of disinfectant spray which is supposed to smell like orange blossoms but smells more like industrial (or outhouse) disinfectant. Before getting these items, I had to wade through a slew of listings to weed out the blatant price gougers. $75+ for a can of Lysol? I don't think so! Why do I need this stuff? I live in a building with a lot of people (who have a lot of visitors), a mail room, laundry room, and common areas, and you just don't know who has what or touched what. I'm not punching elevator buttons without a wipe in my hand while this virus is running rampant. We know this disease will peak and then ebb at some point. That is not to say there won't be a resurgence in the future. I'm pretty sure it's highly likely. I plan to have enough supplies on hand if and when that time comes, whether I need them or not, and avoid a repeat of this craziness. If you'd told me a few months ago that I'd move heaven and hell to get some cleaning supplies, I'd have said youwere crazy. You just never know, do you?

Posing with a Swiffer and its cleaning pads, as well as a bottle of Lysol, box of rubber gloves and a scrub brush on Wednesday, Jessica cheekily captioned her makeup-free photo, â€œHousewife of the Year looks a little different these days.â€ It also should be noted that thereâ€™s a vacuum propped up behind her, showing off that a housewifeâ€™s work is never done, especially during a pandemic where every surface must be sanitized. On top of throwing in additional cleaning supplies, the Open Book author traded in the pink pumps and flirty undergarments for calico-colored slippers and a ripple effect onesie, along with a matching blue and white bandana. Things have radically changed for Jessica since her memorable 2003 magazine cover. Back then, she was starring alongside ex-husband Nick Lachey in their reality TV show Newlyweds and her song â€œWith Youâ€ was atop the US Mainstream Top 40 list. Nowadays, sheâ€™s a New York Times bestselling author with her autobiography Open Book and is focused on her clothing line â€” when sheâ€™s not doting on her three children eight-year-old Maxwell, seven-year-old Ace and one-year-old Birdie Mae. On top of that, sheâ€™s been using her free time to comfort fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging everyone last Wednesday to pray with her â€œfor the leaders around the world including our president, governors, mayors, politicians, scientists, doctors, and all healthcare workersâ€ and told fans to â€œstay strong.â€

@99freemind @realDonaldTrump How can a cold virus -- which is what a coronavirus is -- be vaccinated? There are countless strains.This one was # 19! It is IMPOSSIBLE to vaccinate against ALL cold viruses. Lysol kills "coronavirus" -- it's right on the can! How did ppl in China recover WITHOUT a vax???
@ABC @TheView I have a question can Lysol kill the Covid 19 on surfaces?
@AC360 Can people spray Lysol on masks so they can be re-used? Will that sufficiently kill Covid19?
@audlaq @SKSSKanz @LoneWolf907 @elissamg1 @atensnut Look on the back of a Lysol can, Coronavirus has been around for years.
@bikinginla Is Lysol even effective in killing coronavirus?

@ChrissyFireWat1 @HollyWilhelm4 When they named this NEW virus & ppl we're slapping it back in their face showing its on the back of Lysol cans and they said Oh S### & changed it to COVID19. Same thing different name. That tell you right there is more to it than this SCAMDEMIC.
@defnotMoiz @monifromthemoon Covid 19 is flu and fever like symptoms. Is it not? Coronavirus been around waaayyyyy longer than the last few months ppl were introduced to it. Like I said, do your research then come debate with me. Even the lysol cans have it on them. The ones everyone buying.

I do know of another shop that is openly open but he cuts all the LE and fire dept hair so they seem to be giving him a pass. He did tint all the windows on his shop though
@Ken19512 @MrMichaelBurkes Fact: Coronavirus has been around for decades. Lysol has it listed on their labels. It is a nasty virus. Lucky you if you donâ€™t get it.

@TheDailyShow @JasonCole62 Itâ€™s identified as â€œCovid-19â€ because thatâ€™s when it was discovered. The strain that has killed so many was not known before the Chinese isolated it in December of 2019. Corona viruses have been known for more than 50 years. Check the back of a can of Lysol. Stop the politics.
@ThisIsRobThomas 0.0002% of population will die of coronavirus . Iâ€™ll wash hands , Lysol but the rest is overdoing it .
@trump_noodle @skb_sara Yes, I think they would. However, they are reporting ALL deaths as Covid 19. Heart attacks, cancer, pneumonia, flu, etc. The original Corona virus, is listed on the back of the Lysol Disinfectant can. It's a cold. So, a bad cold?
[QUOTE="BroncMom, post: 7285739, member: 219224"] So the bigger concern (you'd think) would be your SHOES... Have u heard anyone saying anything about that? It can live on the soles of your shoes up to 3 days but yeah, u never hear any of the talking heads telling u to take ur shoes off outside and spray them with Lysol before u bring them in the house... The whole thing really is kinda ridiculous imo... I dunno... Sometimes a little common sense (and less paranoia) goes a long way... [/QUOTE] My buddy works for a large brewery here and anytime they leave the facility when they come back in they get their temp taken and have a bleach bath for their shoes
[QUOTE="pfun41, post: 7285860, member: 38569"]There is no win no matter what the government does. Do nothing and everyone gets sick and people die.Then everyone complains they didn't do enough. Shut everything down and prevent it from getting out of hand and everyone claims they were overreacting and the problem was exaggerated. Projections are pretty much guesses based on what is known from the most similar situations that have already occurred, they are by no means 100% accurate. [URL unfurl="true"]https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/trumps-top-health-officials-predict-diminished-coronavirus-death-toll-171456[/URL] In this article (one of the few I can find on new projections) specifically states that previous projections assumed that only half of Americans would follow social distancing, whereas many more ended up doing so. so yeah, that will drop the projected death toll quite a lot. TBH, people only took measures because they are scared. When people are complacent that's when shit goes south. I have no spray lysol. But I presume misted gear oil will have the same effect. Does it come in yellow? It has to yellow, that's non negotiable. I'm not in this boat so I'm not clear on the details but it sounds like Florida's unemployment system is apparently shit and many won't even get unemployment much less payment while they're out of work. I've made an observation. IDK if they drank conspiracy theory cool aid or don't have TV/internet or what but alot of old people (the demographic most at risk) didn't seem to get the memo. They're the ones wanting to walk right up to us while we're doing gutters. FFS there's a damn pandemic and your standing literally a foot from us messing with our materials. The ****?[/QUOTE] Old people dgaf anymore, they've been through this media circus countless times and aren't afraid of death Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
[quote=Colt Hero;307619]There's currently no scientific proof that Lysol (or Clorox products) kills this new ("novel") Caronavirus. From what I've read, the way it works is the manufacturers apply for an "Emerging Pathogens Claim" that allows them to [I][B]say[/B][/I] it's effective ... even if there's no scientific proof (yet) that it is. .[/quote] Technically correct, that is nobody has taken a surface with corona virus and wiped it with lysol and shown there none existent afterwards. But we don't need to. A virus is just genetic material encased in a lipid like material. Anything to dissolve the fatty layer that protects its innards destroy the virus...anything that dissolves that fat works. That is why soapy water works or isopropyl alcohol works...on any and all viruses. people have been looking at this virus a lot ...if this one was encased in a steel protective layer we would know by now :) Keep washing hands regularly and wiping with alcohol solutions of some sort ...surfaces that are touched by a lot of people...i.e what i do when i go the store...i take a couple of wipes they provide to wipe the trolley and wipe the refrigerator doors before i open it and after and all the surfaces i touch. behave just like the whole world are the sweaty smelly people at the gym..clean before and after using an apparatus !
[quote=FLSlim;5333160]Great choice you are considering. I would avoid Clorox wipes (caustic) and go with lysol if you want a spray on-wipe off product. Than, as already said, wipe down the pistol with an oily rag.[/quote] True dat on the Chlorox. Chlorine is NOT firearms friendly. Isopropyl alcohol would be fine. Dries fast too.
[quote=JGKC9AYC;5333140]I'm going to try and go to my LGS (yes, Governor said they're a necessity!) tomorrow. I plan on wearing my mask and nitrile gloves to handle them. I don't know how long the germ stays "active" on a metal surface (metal is porous, isn't it), but I'll either spray it with Lysol or wipe it down with a disinfectant wipe, then fieldstrip and clean it, assuming I get one.[/quote] And take off and dispose of the gloves as soon as you are outside. Do not touch your car keys, door handle, face, eyes, etc. or they may become contaminated.

A New Jersey Democrat lawmaker whose county is known for producing most of the countryâ€™s Lysol disinfectant was caught on video â€œjokinglyâ€ fantasizing about withholding Lysol from the residents of Kentucky. Why the residents of Kentucky? So that he, former Obama State Department official and current New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, can stick it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and force the Kentucky senator to pass one of his Democrat colleagueâ€™s bills. â€œFun fact about Somerset County [New Jersey]: We make 100 percent of the national supply of Lysol disinfectant,â€ Malinowski was caught saying in a video conference recording that was obtained by the National Republican Congressional Committee. â€œIâ€™ve thought about using with Mitch McConnell, like, â€˜Hey, weâ€™re going to hold up the Lysol for Kentucky until you pass her bill.â€™ I see some thumbs up, but thatâ€™s a fantasy that I donâ€™t think, itâ€™s not going to work that way.â€ Was that supposed to be funny? Listen: Itâ€™s not clear whom heâ€™d meant with he spoke of passing â€œher bill.â€ Itâ€™s also not clear when the video was recorded. The NRCC unveiled it on Twitter at 6:35 PM EST Thursday afternoon, a few hours after Malinowskiâ€™s Democrat colleagues in the Senate blocked a GOP bill that would have provided small businesses with an additional $250 in federal loans. â€œSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., proposed legislation that would boost the popular Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by $250 billion in addition to the $349 billion Congress approved last month as part of the $2.2 trillion pandemic response known as the CARES Act,â€ USA Today â€œMcConnell said the money was needed to keep afloat a program that has processed more than $100 billion in loans to nearly 400,000 businesses in less than a week, according to the Small Business Administration.â€ Following the failed vote, Malinowski predictably attributed his â€œnoâ€ vote to President Donald Trumpâ€™s recent actions, namely his recent termination of former intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson: However, social media users werenâ€™t convinced by his excuse. Look: Of the mounting criticism, the key one concerned â€œpork.â€ As noted by a couple critics, Malinowski joined his Democrat colleagues in the House last month in trying to hijack the original emergency coronavirus spending bill (i.e., the CARES Act) with a whole host of unrelated matter, including provisions concerning voting. In fact, the New Jersey lawmaker was prominently featured in a late March report from The Washington Post titled, â€œ Democrats see coronavirus stimulus as last, best chance for vote-by-mail push.â€ And there it was â€¦ So besides rooting for the residents of Kentucky to be denied access to much-needed Lysol disinfectant, Malinowski also has a history of trying to muddy up emergency coronavirus spending bills with unrelated nonsense. What a guy â€¦ All this comes amid a nationwide shortage in disinfectants. â€œAs the coronavirus locks down more of the country, shelf after shelf of Lysol sprays and Clorox wipes has been picked clean by shoppers preparing for the possibility that they could be quarantined for weeks or months,â€ USA Today reported Thursday.

ABC/Randy Holmes (LOS ANGELES) â€” Itâ€™s been 17 years since Jessica Simpson donned the pink high heels and posed in her underwear with a Swiffer Wet Jet for the cover of Rolling Stone, where she was dubbed â€œHousewife of the Year.â€ Now, the â€œIrresistibleâ€ singer â€” who is a mother of three â€” is reclaiming her old title for a COVID-19 update. Posing with a Swiffer and its cleaning pads, as well as a bottle of Lysol, box of rubber gloves and a scrub brush on Wednesday, Jessica cheekily captioned her makeup-free photo, â€œHousewife of the Year looks a little different these days.â€ It also should be noted that thereâ€™s a vacuum propped up behind her, showing off that a housewifeâ€™s work is never done, especially during a pandemic where every surface must be sanitized. On top of throwing in additional cleaning supplies, the Open Book author traded in the pink pumps and flirty undergarments for calico-colored slippers and a ripple effect onesie, along with a matching blue and white bandana. Things have radically changed for Jessica since her memorable 2003 magazine cover. Back then, she was starring alongside ex-husband Nick Lachey in their reality TV show Newlyweds and her song â€œWith Youâ€ was atop the US Mainstream Top 40 list. Nowadays, sheâ€™s a New York Times bestselling author with her autobiography Open Book and is focused on her clothing line â€” when sheâ€™s not doting on her three children eight-year-old Maxwell, seven-year-old Ace and one-year-old Birdie Mae. On top of that, sheâ€™s been using her free time to comfort fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging everyone last Wednesday to pray with her â€œfor the leaders around the world including our president, governors, mayors, politicians, scientists, doctors, and all healthcare workersâ€ and told fans to â€œstay strong.â€ Copyright Â© 2020, ABC Audio.

ABC/Randy Holmes(LOS ANGELES) -- It's been 17 years sinceJessica Simpsondonned the pink high heels and posed in her underwear with a Swiffer Wet Jet for the cover ofRolling Stone, where she was dubbed "Housewife of the Year." Now, the "Irresistible" singer -- who is a mother of three -- is reclaiming her old title fora COVID-19 update. Posing with a Swiffer and its cleaning pads, as well as a bottle of Lysol, box of rubber gloves and a scrub brush on Wednesday, Jessica cheekily captioned her makeup-free photo, "Housewife of the Year looks a little different these days." It also should be noted that there's a vacuum propped up behind her, showing off that a housewife's work is never done, especially during a pandemic where everysurface must be sanitized. On top of throwing in additional cleaning supplies, theOpen Bookauthor tradedin the pinkpumps and flirty undergarments for calico-colored slippers and a ripple effect onesie, along with a matching blue and white bandana.

I do think that some parents are effing up pretty badly right now. They need their kids out of the house for their own mental health, and it makes them make some really irresponsible choices. They let their 7 year olds, of course without masks, play with their friends out of sight, riding bikes at full speed across and into alleys, while we have fewer and faster cars zooming into and out of alleys at full speed. They're crossing paths with unmasked adults on narrow sidewalks. Calling the more cautious parents the mentally ill ones is not helpful to the purpose of the lockdown. You sound a bit unhinged in certain sections and just as judgy as everyone that you are knocking for calling certain mothers mentally unstable. Do you work for the CDC or in the infectious diseases field? No, then you are guessing too. No one can say with any degree of certainty who is right or wrong here. No, it would not have been reasonable to hoard a 6+ month stash of Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer. If only you and every other hoarder would have listened to that little voice of reason ("second-guessing") and bought a normal amount, maybe we wouldn't have induced a full-scale panic and made it impossible for everyone to have supplies, including people who DIVERTED supplies from FRONT LINE individuals, who are not holed up in their homes practicing how to disinfect groceries. And probably soak their berries in soapy water.

As a young labor organizer and a gay activist, I became a member of the steering committee that led the fight against California Proposition 64 in Los Angeles, a plan to put gay men and people with AIDS in camps. It was 1986. Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had become a tsunami in Africa and across the globe but was still largely ignored by Reagan administration. Unlike Africa and other continents where primarily heterosexual people were becoming infected, gay men and IV drug users were the first to be stricken in large numbers across the United States. The concentration of cases within these marginalized communities (quickly followed by a disproportionate number of deaths among African Americans and hemophiliacs) brought out the worst in conservative Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell [1] who were quick to blame the epidemic on its victims. President Reagan also allowed his prejudice to guide his response. For over four years he refused to even utter the word AIDS and ignored the cries of public health experts who urged him to take action and allocate resources to fight it. By the mid-eighties the LGBTQ community was under full-blown attack. While thousands of our friends and family were sick and dying Lyndon LaRouche, a right wing conspiracy theorist, seized the epidemic to promote himself politically. He ignored the solid research of established scientists that had determined HIV was spread by intimate contact with an infected person or their blood, claiming instead that the virus was spread through casual contact like the common cold and that the World Health Organization and the CDC were â€œviciously lying to the publicâ€ [2] . He then formed an organization he called PANIC -- "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" and paid people to gather signatures for a proposition to be put on the ballot in California. The result was Proposition 64 which would have mandated the creation of concentration camps for hundreds of thousands of gay men and people with HIV, including children. At a time when we were losing so many of our loved ones, this initiative forced the community to take action. We responded like never before and built a campaign that galvanized people across the state --gay and straight. By the end of the summer, we had succeeded in defeating LaRouche's initiative. I n the process, we developed a level of political power and organizing skill that helped build long-lasting community organizations and had a profound impact on our place in American society. As I have hunkered down in my home these last few weeks and watched the Corona Virus epidemic explode across the U.S. and the rest of the planet, I am struck by how many aspects of the current political response mirrors what we experienced during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It was a scary, harrowing time and was made much worse by the abysmal response of President Reagan who, like Trump, put politics and prejudice ahead of public health. Then as now, this resulted in many more infections and deaths that could (and should) have been avoided. These similarities have led me to look back at how the gay and lesbian community responded more than three decades ago and at the effect that all that work had on the epidemic and on our country. While we have not eradicated HIV/AIDS, we did ultimately find treatments that today have allowed millions of people to live long lives even after infection (as long as they can afford it). It took years to find the right drugs and a herculean effort by thousands of professionals and volunteers to slow the spread of HIV. In the process, we learned many valuable lessons â€“ lessons that can be applied to the crisis at hand and help us navigate the coming days and months in our fight to overcome Covid â€“ 19. Here are some of the most salient: Testing is critical. Once the method of transmission was understood, an enormous effort was made to encourage anyone who had sexual contact with an infected person, gay men, hemophiliacs and IV drug users to get tested. In an effort to save lives, contacts of those who were positive were identified and also urged to get tested. This was the ONLY means of slowing the spread of the virus and without a doubt saved millions of lives. I would even go so far as to say that without all that effort by many people over many years, we may easily have seen the spread mirror most other parts of the world. There could have been just as large of an explosion of HIV in the general community in the U.S. People do sleep with each other all the time, after all. But HIV is much harder to transmit and the spread was much slower than what we dealing with now. In the face of the Corona virus, HIV looks like a luxury disease. This new pandemic is moving like wildfire because it does spread through a simple cough. We need to follow the guidance of Dr. Fauci and other medical and scientists (who gained their expertise through the HIV/AIDS epidemic) in every respect, including testing as many as possible as quickly as possible. Don't waste your time with conspiracy theories. In the early days of the HIV epidemic LaRouche was not the only one spreading conspiracy theories about its origin. There were rumors that some kind of bio warfare germ had been spread in gay bath houses in New York City and that this was the cause of the epidemic. I have heard similar theories about a bio-lab near Wuhan. With Corona-Virus, scientists have already traced its roots to a wet market where like HIV, it jumped from wild animals to humans. Regardless, It's a waste of time. It really doesn't matter if the conspiracy were true or not. Conspiracy theories are only about blaming someone else or worse, failing to take responsibility for what we can do today. All that matters is that we stop the spread as quickly as possible and that takes responsible, consistent action by all of us like staying home and using a mask. Once it sinks in, the numbers are overwhelming. I will never forget the day I heard Surgeon General C. Everett Koop present his report to the California Legislature. I had been invited to join a group of gay community leaders who were involved in lobbying for money for HIV testing and services for people with AIDS. The Surgeon General's speech was very progressive at the time because unlike Reagan, Koop refused to be silent. He put ideology aside and relied on his own medical experience and other professional health experts to guide his policy recommendations, including â€œa call to action for sex education and AIDS preventionâ€ [3] . As we sat in the balcony of the hall packed with legislators from across the state, he laid out his agenda for addressing the crisis. The speech was impressive and I was very moved, but what I remember the most was my reaction later. That night I flew home, walked into my kitchen and collapsed sobbing into the arms of my girlfriend. It took a few hours, but the gravity of Koop's message had sunk in. For the first time I understood that it was not just the dozens of friends and acquaintances I knew already. Many thousands of people were going to die. This is exactly the moment we are in now. This is what it means when they say we should prepare for the â€œworst week yet .â€ Thousands of people we all know and love are going to die. Prepare to grieve. We will lose plenty of talent. About 32 million people have died worldwide since the start of the AIDS epidemic and even more are living with it today. In the early years, we lost so many celebrities - Alvin Ailey, Isaac Asimov, Nureyev, Arthur Ashe â€“ and thousands of men and women who were not as famous, but touched so many lives around them. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the men I knew and loved â€“ many of them very talented leaders, artists, thinkers, athletes â€“ had survived. Yesterday I awoke to the news of John Prine's passing. He was one of the most influential songwriters of my childhood. My family's hippie church had a half dozen of his tunes in our songbook and we sang them religiously nearly every week. I immediately turned on YouTube and played an early video of him performing Souvenirs . I've been crying all morning. There are no â€œspecialâ€ people. It may be human nature to look for things that make us special. We want to identify with â€œwinnersâ€, â€œheroesâ€ and â€œgreatsâ€ and we assume that if they are special (as we wish to be) then they are immune. This is not the case. Yesterday the U.K.'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care. As a leader who doesn't believe in trusting experts and scientists, he ignored the warnings and failed to practice social distancing. In essence, he thought he was special and had the magical immunity that many right wing conservatives are still clinging to. The reality is that you may be able to affect politics and policy based on beliefs, but you cannot believe your way into immunity. Period. This week Baton Rouge Pastor Tony Spell told the Washington Post â€œWe feel we are being persecuted for the faith by being told to close our doors.â€ [4] I expect we will see a jump in deaths from churches like these and the communities around them where their followers may continue to ignore expert guidance. Christian evangelist fundamentalism is grounded in the belief that followers are â€œspecialâ€ because they have been saved. Every aspect of their belief system and politics flows from the idea that they have a unique relationship with God and a better understanding of what they (and all the rest of us) should do or not do. The same rhetoric was used against the gay community, Africans and African Americans to point the finger of responsibility back to the victims rather than expend resources saving lives. The same thing happened during the great plague in Europe. As millions were dying some people went to crazy lengths and joined religious cults in an attempt to be â€œspecialâ€ enough to save their lives. Large groups of Flagellants went from town to town lashing their backs bloody and whipping up townsfolk into a frenzy of religious fervor. It didn't help. More likely, the public gathering and blood letting only made things worse. Similar episodes are playing out online as well as in churches such as a Texas woman who died of Covid-19 last week. She was convinced that the epidemic was a â€œmedia-driven hoaxâ€ and had expressed her outrage on Facebook writing â€œ You don't need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!â€ [5] Her beliefs didn't save her but honest, fact-based reporting might have. Fear comes easily and often leads to violence. Little is more predictable these days than right-wing conservatives blaming a group of â€˜different' people for a crisis and then taking the first opportunity to attack them violently. Gay bashing nearly moved from the fringes to mainstream at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Now, thanks to our President's misdirection and use of the phrase â€œChinese Flu ,â€ violent attacks against Asian Americans have risen sharply. Absolutely everyone everywhere must speak out against this race-baiting. Not only is it unwarranted and inaccurate, but the very idea that a single ethnicity or group of people spread the virus will only cost more lives. I used to wonder at the insanity of these attacks since violently attacking people you think may be exposed increased the risk of exposure to their blood and thereby transmission. This time around, all you have to do is breathe. More importantly, it reinforces the idea that somehow if you could eliminate one group of people you could avoid becoming infected. This is not a group infection, it's a human disease. In fact it's just the kind of pandemic that climate change experts have been predicting for years. [6] If there is anyone to blame, it's all of us for not heading their warnings. This is exactly why we need more leaders like Surgeon General Koop who have the strength to put their political views aside and use the platform they have available to focus instead on spreading accurate information and saving lives. The enemy is the same â€“ conservative C hristians' deeply held belief in their superiority, white supremacy and a rejection of science. As mentioned above, conservative evangelicals believe that a â€˜special' event â€“ the experience of being born again â€“ sets them apart from others. They see themselves as superior because their religion's core message is that they are the â€˜chosen ones They are the few who will go to heaven when others who have not had the same enlightenment experience (or whom the bible says are sinners) will not. This is fundamental to their world view. It took me many years of living in the southern United States to understand how deep this belief in personal superiority is. For many people it is essential to their sense of self. This is especially true for white conservatives for whom their superior religious position is intertwined with their faith in white supremacy. This makes rejection of scientific inquiry not only easy, but essential. One must dismiss a lot of facts if you believe that the only way to get into heaven is to be superior in some way to other people. More to the point: if heaven is a zero sum game, then everyone else MUST loose. This is the kind of fundamentalism that both Bush presidencies were known for. Trump too built his following and then his presidential campaign on white supremacist conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace. This is where conservative Christianity and white supremacy meet because as soon as you reject facts in favor of personal superiority, the suffering of others does not matter. This world view is most dangerous at a time like this. It's not ignorance, it's the core belief among people who truly think that their faith will save them and even if they die, they are the only ones who will get to go to the right heaven. Leaders who ignore the facts can kill. Not every country experienced the explosion of the virus within the gay community or among IV drug users as in the U.S. There was always plenty of evidence that it was not a gay disease. However, it did start in Africa and spread quickly among straight populations on that continent and within the African American community. These facts served as the perfect combination for conservatives across the country (most notably President Bush) to leverage as a way to attack the victims and avoid providing resources. Millions of people were infected with HIV and died needlessly as a direct result of the stigma attached to AIDS in the United States. Today it is the same religious and political conservatives who are refusing to close their churches and insist that the Corona virus is a hoax. By doing so, they mirror policies like the Bush administration's ban against discussion of condoms and safe sex practices when distributing AIDS education funding. [7] It's been 30 years since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and today there are over 39 million people infected with HIV. [8] Yet HIV is so much more difficult to transmit than Covid-19. It is critical that good leaders who are willing to consider scientific facts and act on the advice of experts take the reins before we see the loss of millions people here and around the globe. Scientists are really smart, compassionate and they know what to do . There is good news in comparing the AIDS epidemic and Covid-19 Precisely because of the AIDS crisis, we have a national and global community of epidemiological experts with deep experience we can trust. This is an enormous advantage that did not exist in the 1980's. Doctor Fauci has emerged as a leader in recent weeks because he has the experience and expertise we so desperately need. It is also worth noting that because he started his career through HIV/AIDS work which makes him uniquely qualified to deal with leaders like those in the Trump administration who prefer their own story. He's seen this playbook before. Now Dr. Fauci is facing attacks from trolls and from within the administration. He needs all the help and support he can get if he is going to remain in his current role as a public health communicator. We need him to stay right where he is â€“ on our TV screens every day. Women will always rise to the challenge. There's an old joke that goes â€œAn army of ex-lovers cannot fail .â€ This was usually applied to the lesbian community due to our habit of maintaining friendships with old partners. During the height of the AIDS epidemic when virtually all of us were losing dozens of friends every year thousands of lesbians and other women joined their gay male friends and stepped up to care for our fallen. We fed and housed them, drove them to clinics and hospitals, sat by the bedside and made millions of phone calls in search of resources, filled out paperwork for friends too sick to get help. We too laid down in the streets in protest to fight for those services. As the Corona pandemic has impacted life around the world, women are carrying a great burden on all fronts â€“ as service workers, at home trying to work while parenting, in hospitals and nursing facilities where we make up 70% of medical staff, etc. [9] For women losing jobs or income, it's often harder to recover financially since our paychecks are smaller on average to start with. Once again, this crisis is highlighting the vulnerability of women and families in an economic system that undervalues our work and provides few safety nets. People of color will be hit bigger and harder. This is an issue that emerged early and still exists with new HIV/AIDS cases today. According to the CDC in 2018 there were nearly 30% more black vs. white men who contracted HIV through male to male contact. The percentage of heterosexual African American women vs. new cases among their white peers is even higher [10] . As the death toll from Covid-19 rises, the alarm bell is ringing once again because in many areas people of color are dying at a much higher rate [11] . This has everything to do with lack of access to healthcare, the funds to pay for it and higher rates of poverty. It is what happens when a group of people are undervalued and oppressed for generations. There is really no excuse for the fact that nearly forty years after the first American AIDS cases were identified such a glaring disparity should continue with either virus. We have to fightâ€¦ fight like hell on every front. It took a few years for people to organize in large numbers during the AIDS epidemic. When the first few dozen people died and it was clear that gay men were especially vulnerable, there were articles in the community press and whispers grew into larger conversations pretty quickly. But as dozens became hundreds and then thousands of people dying around the country the outcry from the gay and lesbian community was loud and consistent. We lobbied for health care and research funding from the CDC. We argued for testing, for clinics and to expedite trials for early experimental drugs like AZT. It was the AIDS crisis that brought some of us out of the closet and carried gay politics into the mainstream. We had no choice. We were dying and we were under attack by a right-wing political agenda that aggressively sought to silence our voices and marginalize the growing loss of life. Within the community there were roaring debates between different activists over strategy. Was it better to push for policy within the establishment and cultivate political allies or should we protest in the streets? â€œQueerâ€ was added to gay/lesbian during this period as a descriptor for our community by those who were outraged by the government's poor response to an epidemic that was killing us. Along with the ACT UP slogan â€œSilence = Deathâ€, calling ourselves queer was a way to say â€œWe're here! We are not going away and we are not going to hide!â€ We challenged politicians who held the purse strings to funds that were desperately needed to care for the sick and to find a cure. At that time I was working on policy and not always a fan of the â€œin your faceâ€ approach. In retrospect, however, the lesson is clear: we need all of it. It took all of us working inside traditional channels, building new organizations within the community and protesting in the streets to make the changes that had to happen if we were going to save lives. When we fight for the resources, we win. As I watch this new pandemic overtake our country, I am outraged. I see the same playbook being used to fragment our society at the very moment we need to pull together and support each other the most. But I am not disheartened. I have lived through this before and I know what is possible when we do stand up against lies and disinformation. Even with the loss of so many of our brothers and sisters, the gay and lesbian community grew stronger. We raised millions of dollars and built institutions that still serve us today. It can be done but action and activism is required â€” and there is no time to lose. This will change society. Over the course of about ten years, I watched it happen. Straight people who would never have admitted to having a gay brother or aunt began to speak of their loved ones more openly. Corporate leaders joined committees and boards for organizations dedicated to fighting AIDS and fundraisers grew along with a proliferation of red ribbons at the Oscars. In the long run, and at great cost, our fight to save our friends and lovers brought about a level of acceptance and integration into society that we hardly dared to dream of when I was first coming out in 1979. The legalization of gay marriage is one of the most dramatic examples of how far the will to fight for your lives can affect change. The question is what change do we want to see? What are we willing to fight for now that our lives are on the line? Elections Matter. Imagine if a democratic president like Jimmy Carter had still been in office when HIV hit the United States? What would the reaction of a humanitarian leader have been as compared to Ronald Reagan and what difference could it have made? Some democratic leaders are stronger than others. Some more or less compassionate. But remember that President Carter had the vision to put solar panels on top of the white house way back in 1979. Today his solar farm is providing half of the energy for his hometown in Georgia [12] . How would Hillary Clinton have responded to the corona virus crisis by now? Would she have ever made a statement like â€œ One day it's like a miracle, it will disappearâ€ [13] or threaten to withhold supplies and emergency funding from Governors â€œwho don't treat you right.â€ [14] ? This is not rhetoric. These are important questions because lives are on the line. For all of the weaknesses of the Democratic party, regardless of religion or one's political leanings, we all have to ask ourselves whether we can really afford to â€˜drain the swap' that is Washington D.C. of its institutions, intelligence and expertise. We are living with the results of decades in which the Republican southern strategy, aligned with conservative Christians and corporatocracy has succeeded in leaving the halls of our government so empty of experience, expertise and strong leadership that a man like Donald Trump was able to waltz right through the void and into the presidency. Now we are all paying the price, including the millions of human beings who live in the southern states and are now on the precipice of a health disaster unseen since World War I. Unlike the last flu pandemic, however, we know what to do. President Obama had left the country well prepared for another outbreak like this. Then Tr ump threw out the plans, the teams and even the department staff who were at the ready and could have helped our country avoid the enormous losses we are only beginning to see. This is why elections matter. By all accounts this week's v oting in Wisconsin is a pre-cursor of what is likely to come if Republican strategists continue to subvert the democratic process and suppress the vote in November. If we want to have any say in the direction our country takes during and after this epidemic, every American must be able to vote and every one who cares will have to work hard to ensure that all votes are counted. We are the moral majority. Why do we love disaster movies? I think it's because they are always about life and death situations that bring out the true character of the people involved. Until effective treatments were discovered HIV/AIDS was a monumental crisis in the United States and, of course for millions all over the world. We lost a nearly unimaginable number of people in a very short amount of time â€” people with whom we shared life and love, fun, pain and pride. It's impossible to measure what society as a whole lost in terms of talent, art, productivity, great leadership, literature, etc. But we also gained something of immense value. In the face of great loss, millions of Americans from all walks of life stood up. They rejected centuries of taboos and laws against homosexuality and declared their love for family, friends and colleagues they had lost to HIV/AIDS. They gave money, put on ribbons and talked freely about a beloved uncle who had previously been relegated to silent shadows on the family tree. We did so because we knew it was simply immoral not to. When we did, we found we were not alone and this made all the difference. We can do the same thing now. Despite what FOX News and the conservative voices would have you believe, progressive politics and liberal social views are still the majority. If this was not the case, Republicans would not work so hard to suppress voting rights. We know what to do and how to win. The only question is when. How many will die before we are ready to stand up, head into the streets and the board rooms and fight again? We lost many great people and important leaders through the AIDS epidemic. We are about to lose as many if not more with this new virus. This is both scary and heartbreaking. At the same time, we should remember that an entire generation of leaders cut their teeth on organizing as a result of the HIV/AIDS crisis and won many victories . We can also do this again. Many of those early organizers went on to pursue professional lives, built organizations and ran for office. They became doctors and healthcare workers and continued to make a difference in people's lives for over three decades. We don't have to start over again. Many of us are still around and have a wealth of experience and expertise to share. A final thought: One afternoon in the middle of the No on 64 campaign I was working in the Los Angeles headquarters when I overheard a conversation I will never forget. About half a dozen young gay men in their early 20's were busy stuffing envelopes around a couple of long tables in the middle of the office while I sat on the side working with a staff member on contribution reports. They came in on a bright, sunny Saturday to volunteer their time and energy to save lives and stop a terribly misguided piece of legislation. It could have put them all in camps within months if it had passed. Unlike myself, who tends to work too much and usually very seriously, these guys turned the whole place into a party. They gossiped and joked and laughed uproariously for a couple of hours while they worked. The Gay Pride Parade was just a week away, which prompted a wild discussion about the costumes they planned to wear, each more outrageous than the next. It was thoroughly entertaining and after a while I found myself deeply moved. I couldn't help but be struck by the way they laughed and played and chose to enjoy life even at such a dangerous time. In all likelihood, some of them were already HIV positive and could soon be sick or dying but that's not where they put their focus. Those beautiful men taught me one of the most important lessons I have ever learned that day. No matter what is happening or who is threatening to take us down, we must live and enjoy life. It's the most precious thing we have. It's worth fighting for. Â© 2020, KJ Miller | The opinions expressed here are mine and not those of my employer.

As a young labor organizer and a gay activist, I became a member of the steering committee that led the fight against California Proposition 64 in Los Angeles, a plan to put gay men and people with AIDS in camps. It was 1986. Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had become a tsunami in Africa and across the globe but was still largely ignored by Reagan administration. Unlike Africa and other continents where primarily heterosexual people were becoming infected, gay men and IV drug users were the first to be stricken in large numbers across the United States. The concentration of cases within these marginalized communities (quickly followed by a disproportionate number of deaths among African Americans and hemophiliacs) brought out the worst in conservative Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell [1] who were quick to blame the epidemic on its victims. President Reagan also allowed his prejudice to guide his response. For over four years he refused to even utter the word AIDS and ignored the cries of public health experts who urged him to take action and allocate resources to fight it. By the mid-eighties the LGBTQ community was under full-blown attack. While thousands of our friends and family were sick and dying Lyndon LaRouche, a right wing conspiracy theorist, seized the epidemic to promote himself politically. He ignored the solid research of established scientists that had determined HIV was spread by intimate contact with an infected person or their blood, claiming instead that the virus was spread through casual contact like the common cold and that the World Health Organization and the CDC were â€œviciously lying to the publicâ€ [2] . He then formed an organization he called PANIC -- "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" and paid people to gather signatures for a proposition to be put on the ballot in California. The result was Proposition 64 which would have mandated the creation of concentration camps for hundreds of thousands of gay men and people with HIV, including children. At a time when we were losing so many of our loved ones, this initiative forced the community to take action. We responded like never before and built a campaign that galvanized people across the state --gay and straight. By the end of the summer, we had succeeded in defeating LaRouche's initiative. I n the process, we developed a level of political power and organizing skill that helped build long-lasting community organizations and had a profound impact on our place in American society. As I have hunkered down in my home these last few weeks and watched the Corona Virus epidemic explode across the U.S. and the rest of the planet, I am struck by how many aspects of the current political response mirrors what we experienced during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It was a scary, harrowing time and was made much worse by the abysmal response of President Reagan who, like Trump, put politics and prejudice ahead of public health. Then as now, this resulted in many more infections and deaths that could (and should) have been avoided. These similarities have led me to look back at how the gay and lesbian community responded more than three decades ago and at the effect that all that work had on the epidemic and on our country. While we have not eradicated HIV/AIDS, we did ultimately find treatments that today have allowed millions of people to live long lives even after infection (as long as they can afford it). It took years to find the right drugs and a herculean effort by thousands of professionals and volunteers to slow the spread of HIV. In the process, we learned many valuable lessons â€“ lessons that can be applied to the crisis at hand and help us navigate the coming days and months in our fight to overcome Covid â€“ 19. Here are some of the most salient: Testing is critical. Once the method of transmission was understood, an enormous effort was made to encourage anyone who had sexual contact with an infected person, gay men, hemophiliacs and IV drug users to get tested. In an effort to save lives, contacts of those who were positive were identified and also urged to get tested. This was the ONLY means of slowing the spread of the virus and without a doubt saved millions of lives. I would even go so far as to say that without all that effort by many people over many years, we may easily have seen the spread mirror most other parts of the world. There could have been just as large of an explosion of HIV in the general community in the U.S. People do sleep with each other all the time, after all. But HIV is much harder to transmit and the spread was much slower than what we dealing with now. In the face of the Corona virus, HIV looks like a luxury disease. This new pandemic is moving like wildfire because it does spread through a simple cough. We need to follow the guidance of Dr. Fauci and other medical and scientists (who gained their expertise through the HIV/AIDS epidemic) in every respect, including testing as many as possible as quickly as possible. Don't waste your time with conspiracy theories. In the early days of the HIV epidemic LaRouche was not the only one spreading conspiracy theories about its origin. There were rumors that some kind of bio warfare germ had been spread in gay bath houses in New York City and that this was the cause of the epidemic. I have heard similar theories about a bio-lab near Wuhan. With Corona-Virus, scientists have already traced its roots to a wet market where like HIV, it jumped from wild animals to humans. Regardless, It's a waste of time. It really doesn't matter if the conspiracy were true or not. Conspiracy theories are only about blaming someone else or worse, failing to take responsibility for what we can do today. All that matters is that we stop the spread as quickly as possible and that takes responsible, consistent action by all of us like staying home and using a mask. Once it sinks in, the numbers are overwhelming. I will never forget the day I heard Surgeon General C. Everett Koop present his report to the California Legislature. I had been invited to join a group of gay community leaders who were involved in lobbying for money for HIV testing and services for people with AIDS. The Surgeon General's speech was very progressive at the time because unlike Reagan, Koop refused to be silent. He put ideology aside and relied on his own medical experience and other professional health experts to guide his policy recommendations, including â€œa call to action for sex education and AIDS preventionâ€ [3] . As we sat in the balcony of the hall packed with legislators from across the state, he laid out his agenda for addressing the crisis. The speech was impressive and I was very moved, but what I remember the most was my reaction later. That night I flew home, walked into my kitchen and collapsed sobbing into the arms of my girlfriend. It took a few hours, but the gravity of Koop's message had sunk in. For the first time I understood that it was not just the dozens of friends and acquaintances I knew already. Many thousands of people were going to die. This is exactly the moment we are in now. This is what it means when they say we should prepare for the â€œworst week yet .â€ Thousands of people we all know and love are going to die. Prepare to grieve. We will lose plenty of talent. About 32 million people have died worldwide since the start of the AIDS epidemic and even more are living with it today. In the early years, we lost so many celebrities - Alvin Ailey, Isaac Asimov, Nureyev, Arthur Ashe â€“ and thousands of men and women who were not as famous, but touched so many lives around them. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the men I knew and loved â€“ many of them very talented leaders, artists, thinkers, athletes â€“ had survived. Yesterday I awoke to the news of John Prine's passing. He was one of the most influential songwriters of my childhood. My family's hippie church had a half dozen of his tunes in our songbook and we sang them religiously nearly every week. I immediately turned on YouTube and played an early video of him performing Souvenirs . I've been crying all morning. There are no â€œspecialâ€ people. It may be human nature to look for things that make us special. We want to identify with â€œwinnersâ€, â€œheroesâ€ and â€œgreatsâ€ and we assume that if they are special (as we wish to be) then they are immune. This is not the case. Yesterday the U.K.'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care. As a leader who doesn't believe in trusting experts and scientists, he ignored the warnings and failed to practice social distancing. In essence, he thought he was special and had the magical immunity that many right wing conservatives are still clinging to. The reality is that you may be able to affect politics and policy based on beliefs, but you cannot believe your way into immunity. Period. This week Baton Rouge Pastor Tony Spell told the Washington Post â€œWe feel we are being persecuted for the faith by being told to close our doors.â€ [4] I expect we will see a jump in deaths from churches like these and the communities around them where their followers may continue to ignore expert guidance. Christian evangelist fundamentalism is grounded in the belief that followers are â€œspecialâ€ because they have been saved. Every aspect of their belief system and politics flows from the idea that they have a unique relationship with God and a better understanding of what they (and all the rest of us) should do or not do. The same rhetoric was used against the gay community, Africans and African Americans to point the finger of responsibility back to the victims rather than expend resources saving lives. The same thing happened during the great plague in Europe. As millions were dying some people went to crazy lengths and joined religious cults in an attempt to be â€œspecialâ€ enough to save their lives. Large groups of Flagellants went from town to town lashing their backs bloody and whipping up townsfolk into a frenzy of religious fervor. It didn't help. More likely, the public gathering and blood letting only made things worse. Similar episodes are playing out online as well as in churches such as a Texas woman who died of Covid-19 last week. She was convinced that the epidemic was a â€œmedia-driven hoaxâ€ and had expressed her outrage on Facebook writing â€œ You don't need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!â€ [5] Her beliefs didn't save her but honest, fact-based reporting might have. Fear comes easily and often leads to violence. Little is more predictable these days than right-wing conservatives blaming a group of â€˜different' people for a crisis and then taking the first opportunity to attack them violently. Gay bashing nearly moved from the fringes to mainstream at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Now, thanks to our President's misdirection and use of the phrase â€œChinese Flu ,â€ violent attacks against Asian Americans have risen sharply. Absolutely everyone everywhere must speak out against this race-baiting. Not only is it unwarranted and inaccurate, but the very idea that a single ethnicity or group of people spread the virus will only cost more lives. I used to wonder at the insanity of these attacks since violently attacking people you think may be exposed increased the risk of exposure to their blood and thereby transmission. This time around, all you have to do is breathe. More importantly, it reinforces the idea that somehow if you could eliminate one group of people you could avoid becoming infected. This is not a group infection, it's a human disease. In fact it's just the kind of pandemic that climate change experts have been predicting for years. [6] If there is anyone to blame, it's all of us for not heading their warnings. This is exactly why we need more leaders like Surgeon General Koop who have the strength to put their political views aside and use the platform they have available to focus instead on spreading accurate information and saving lives. The enemy is the same â€“ conservative C hristians' deeply held belief in their superiority, white supremacy and a rejection of science. As mentioned above, conservative evangelicals believe that a â€˜special' event â€“ the experience of being born again â€“ sets them apart from others. They see themselves as superior because their religion's core message is that they are the â€˜chosen ones They are the few who will go to heaven when others who have not had the same enlightenment experience (or whom the bible says are sinners) will not. This is fundamental to their world view. It took me many years of living in the southern United States to understand how deep this belief in personal superiority is. For many people it is essential to their sense of self. This is especially true for white conservatives for whom their superior religious position is intertwined with their faith in white supremacy. This makes rejection of scientific inquiry not only easy, but essential. One must dismiss a lot of facts if you believe that the only way to get into heaven is to be superior in some way to other people. More to the point: if heaven is a zero sum game, then everyone else MUST loose. This is the kind of fundamentalism that both Bush presidencies were known for. Trump too built his following and then his presidential campaign on white supremacist conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace. This is where conservative Christianity and white supremacy meet because as soon as you reject facts in favor of personal superiority, the suffering of others does not matter. This world view is most dangerous at a time like this. It's not ignorance, it's the core belief among people who truly think that their faith will save them and even if they die, they are the only ones who will get to go to the right heaven. Leaders who ignore the facts can kill. Not every country experienced the explosion of the virus within the gay community or among IV drug users as in the U.S. There was always plenty of evidence that it was not a gay disease. However, it did start in Africa and spread quickly among straight populations on that continent and within the African American community. These facts served as the perfect combination for conservatives across the country (most notably President Bush) to leverage as a way to attack the victims and avoid providing resources. Millions of people were infected with HIV and died needlessly as a direct result of the stigma attached to AIDS in the United States. Today it is the same religious and political conservatives who are refusing to close their churches and insist that the Corona virus is a hoax. By doing so, they mirror policies like the Bush administration's ban against discussion of condoms and safe sex practices when distributing AIDS education funding. [7] It's been 30 years since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and today there are over 39 million people infected with HIV. [8] Yet HIV is so much more difficult to transmit than Covid-19. It is critical that good leaders who are willing to consider scientific facts and act on the advice of experts take the reins before we see the loss of millions people here and around the globe. Scientists are really smart, compassionate and they know what to do . There is good news in comparing the AIDS epidemic and Covid-19 Precisely because of the AIDS crisis, we have a national and global community of epidemiological experts with deep experience we can trust. This is an enormous advantage that did not exist in the 1980's. Doctor Fauci has emerged as a leader in recent weeks because he has the experience and expertise we so desperately need. It is also worth noting that because he started his career through HIV/AIDS work which makes him uniquely qualified to deal with leaders like those in the Trump administration who prefer their own story. He's seen this playbook before. Now Dr. Fauci is facing attacks from trolls and from within the administration. He needs all the help and support he can get if he is going to remain in his current role as a public health communicator. We need him to stay right where he is â€“ on our TV screens every day. Women will always rise to the challenge. There's an old joke that goes â€œAn army of ex-lovers cannot fail .â€ This was usually applied to the lesbian community due to our habit of maintaining friendships with old partners. During the height of the AIDS epidemic when virtually all of us were losing dozens of friends every year thousands of lesbians and other women joined their gay male friends and stepped up to care for our fallen. We fed and housed them, drove them to clinics and hospitals, sat by the bedside and made millions of phone calls in search of resources, filled out paperwork for friends too sick to get help. We too laid down in the streets in protest to fight for those services. As the Corona pandemic has impacted life around the world, women are carrying a great burden on all fronts â€“ as service workers, at home trying to work while parenting, in hospitals and nursing facilities where we make up 70% of medical staff, etc. [9] For women losing jobs or income, it's often harder to recover financially since our paychecks are smaller on average to start with. Once again, this crisis is highlighting the vulnerability of women and families in an economic system that undervalues our work and provides few safety nets. People of color will be hit bigger and harder. This is an issue that emerged early and still exists with new HIV/AIDS cases today. According to the CDC in 2018 there were nearly 30% more black vs. white men who contracted HIV through male to male contact. The percentage of heterosexual African American women vs. new cases among their white peers is even higher [10] . As the death toll from Covid-19 rises, the alarm bell is ringing once again because in many areas people of color are dying at a much higher rate [11] . This has everything to do with lack of access to healthcare, the funds to pay for it and higher rates of poverty. It is what happens when a group of people are undervalued and oppressed for generations. There is really no excuse for the fact that nearly forty years after the first American AIDS cases were identified such a glaring disparity should continue with either virus. We have to fightâ€¦ fight like hell on every front. It took a few years for people to organize in large numbers during the AIDS epidemic. When the first few dozen people died and it was clear that gay men were especially vulnerable, there were articles in the community press and whispers grew into larger conversations pretty quickly. But as dozens became hundreds and then thousands of people dying around the country the outcry from the gay and lesbian community was loud and consistent. We lobbied for health care and research funding from the CDC. We argued for testing, for clinics and to expedite trials for early experimental drugs like AZT. It was the AIDS crisis that brought some of us out of the closet and carried gay politics into the mainstream. We had no choice. We were dying and we were under attack by a right-wing political agenda that aggressively sought to silence our voices and marginalize the growing loss of life. Within the community there were roaring debates between different activists over strategy. Was it better to push for policy within the establishment and cultivate political allies or should we protest in the streets? â€œQueerâ€ was added to gay/lesbian during this period as a descriptor for our community by those who were outraged by the government's poor response to an epidemic that was killing us. Along with the ACT UP slogan â€œSilence = Deathâ€, calling ourselves queer was a way to say â€œWe're here! We are not going away and we are not going to hide!â€ We challenged politicians who held the purse strings to funds that were desperately needed to care for the sick and to find a cure. At that time I was working on policy and not always a fan of the â€œin your faceâ€ approach. In retrospect, however, the lesson is clear: we need all of it. It took all of us working inside traditional channels, building new organizations within the community and protesting in the streets to make the changes that had to happen if we were going to save lives. When we fight for the resources, we win. As I watch this new pandemic overtake our country, I am outraged. I see the same playbook being used to fragment our society at the very moment we need to pull together and support each other the most. But I am not disheartened. I have lived through this before and I know what is possible when we do stand up against lies and disinformation. Even with the loss of so many of our brothers and sisters, the gay and lesbian community grew stronger. We raised millions of dollars and built institutions that still serve us today. It can be done but action and activism is required â€” and there is no time to lose. This will change society. Over the course of about ten years, I watched it happen. Straight people who would never have admitted to having a gay brother or aunt began to speak of their loved ones more openly. Corporate leaders joined committees and boards for organizations dedicated to fighting AIDS and fundraisers grew along with a proliferation of red ribbons at the Oscars. In the long run, and at great cost, our fight to save our friends and lovers brought about a level of acceptance and integration into society that we hardly dared to dream of when I was first coming out in 1979. The legalization of gay marriage is one of the most dramatic examples of how far the will to fight for your lives can affect change. The question is what change do we want to see? What are we willing to fight for now that our lives are on the line? Elections Matter. Imagine if a democratic president like Jimmy Carter had still been in office when HIV hit the United States? What would the reaction of a humanitarian leader have been as compared to Ronald Reagan and what difference could it have made? Some democratic leaders are stronger than others. Some more or less compassionate. But remember that President Carter had the vision to put solar panels on top of the white house way back in 1979. Today his solar farm is providing half of the energy for his hometown in Georgia [12] . How would Hillary Clinton have responded to the corona virus crisis by now? Would she have ever made a statement like â€œ One day it's like a miracle, it will disappearâ€ [13] or threaten to withhold supplies and emergency funding from Governors â€œwho don't treat you right.â€ [14] ? This is not rhetoric. These are important questions because lives are on the line. For all of the weaknesses of the Democratic party, regardless of religion or one's political leanings, we all have to ask ourselves whether we can really afford to â€˜drain the swap' that is Washington D.C. of its institutions, intelligence and expertise. We are living with the results of decades in which the Republican southern strategy, aligned with conservative Christians and corporatocracy has succeeded in leaving the halls of our government so empty of experience, expertise and strong leadership that a man like Donald Trump was able to waltz right through the void and into the presidency. Now we are all paying the price, including the millions of human beings who live in the southern states and are now on the precipice of a health disaster unseen since World War I. Unlike the last flu pandemic, however, we know what to do. President Obama had left the country well prepared for another outbreak like this. Then Tr ump threw out the plans, the teams and even the department staff who were at the ready and could have helped our country avoid the enormous losses we are only beginning to see. This is why elections matter. By all accounts this week's v oting in Wisconsin is a pre-cursor of what is likely to come if Republican strategists continue to subvert the democratic process and suppress the vote in November. If we want to have any say in the direction our country takes during and after this epidemic, every American must be able to vote and every one who cares will have to work hard to ensure that all votes are counted. We are the moral majority. Why do we love disaster movies? I think it's because they are always about life and death situations that bring out the true character of the people involved. Until effective treatments were discovered HIV/AIDS was a monumental crisis in the United States and, of course for millions all over the world. We lost a nearly unimaginable number of people in a very short amount of time â€” people with whom we shared life and love, fun, pain and pride. It's impossible to measure what society as a whole lost in terms of talent, art, productivity, great leadership, literature, etc. But we also gained something of immense value. In the face of great loss, millions of Americans from all walks of life stood up. They rejected centuries of taboos and laws against homosexuality and declared their love for family, friends and colleagues they had lost to HIV/AIDS. They gave money, put on ribbons and talked freely about a beloved uncle who had previously been relegated to silent shadows on the family tree. We did so because we knew it was simply immoral not to. When we did, we found we were not alone and this made all the difference. We can do the same thing now. Despite what FOX News and the conservative voices would have you believe, progressive politics and liberal social views are still the majority. If this was not the case, Republicans would not work so hard to suppress voting rights. We know what to do and how to win. The only question is when. How many will die before we are ready to stand up, head into the streets and the board rooms and fight again? We lost many great people and important leaders through the AIDS epidemic. We are about to lose as many if not more with this new virus. This is both scary and heartbreaking. At the same time, we should remember that an entire generation of leaders cut their teeth on organizing as a result of the HIV/AIDS crisis and won many victories . We can also do this again. Many of those early organizers went on to pursue professional lives, built organizations and ran for office. They became doctors and healthcare workers and continued to make a difference in people's lives for over three decades. We don't have to start over again. Many of us are still around and have a wealth of experience and expertise to share. A final thought: One afternoon in the middle of the No on 64 campaign I was working in the Los Angeles headquarters when I overheard a conversation I will never forget. About half a dozen young gay men in their early 20's were busy stuffing envelopes around a couple of long tables in the middle of the office while I sat on the side working with a staff member on contribution reports. They came in on a bright, sunny Saturday to volunteer their time and energy to save lives and stop a terribly misguided piece of legislation. It could have put them all in camps within months if it had passed. Unlike myself, who tends to work too much and usually very seriously, these guys turned the whole place into a party. They gossiped and joked and laughed uproariously for a couple of hours while they worked. The Gay Pride Parade was just a week away, which prompted a wild discussion about the costumes they planned to wear, each more outrageous than the next. It was thoroughly entertaining and after a while I found myself deeply moved. I couldn't help but be struck by the way they laughed and played and chose to enjoy life even at such a dangerous time. In all likelihood, some of them were already HIV positive and could soon be sick or dying but that's not where they put their focus. Those beautiful men taught me one of the most important lessons I have ever learned that day. No matter what is happening or who is threatening to take us down, we must live and enjoy life. It's the most precious thing we have. It's worth fighting for. Â© 2020, KJ Miller | The opinions expressed here are mine and not those of my employer.

As a young labor organizer and a gay activist, I became a member of the steering committee that led the fight against California Proposition 64 in Los Angeles, a plan to put gay men and people with AIDS in camps. It was 1986. Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had become a tsunami in Africa and across the globe but was still largely ignored by Reagan administration. Unlike Africa and other continents where primarily heterosexual people were becoming infected, gay men and IV drug users were the first to be stricken in large numbers across the United States. The concentration of cases within these marginalized communities (quickly followed by a disproportionate number of deaths among African Americans and hemophiliacs) brought out the worst in conservative Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell [1] who were quick to blame the epidemic on its victims. President Reagan also allowed his prejudice to guide his response. For over four years he refused to even utter the word AIDS and ignored the cries of public health experts who urged him to take action and allocate resources to fight it. By the mid-eighties the LGBTQ community was under full-blown attack. While thousands of our friends and family were sick and dying Lyndon LaRouche, a right wing conspiracy theorist, seized the epidemic to promote himself politically. He ignored the solid research of established scientists that had determined HIV was spread by intimate contact with an infected person or their blood, claiming instead that the virus was spread through casual contact like the common cold and that the World Health Organization and the CDC were â€œviciously lying to the publicâ€ [2] . He then formed an organization he called PANIC -- "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" and paid people to gather signatures for a proposition to be put on the ballot in California. The result was Proposition 64 which would have mandated the creation of concentration camps for hundreds of thousands of gay men and people with HIV, including children. At a time when we were losing so many of our loved ones, this initiative forced the community to take action. We responded like never before and built a campaign that galvanized people across the state --gay and straight. By the end of the summer, we had succeeded in defeating LaRouche's initiative. I n the process, we developed a level of political power and organizing skill that helped build long-lasting community organizations and had a profound impact on our place in American society. As I have hunkered down in my home these last few weeks and watched the Corona Virus epidemic explode across the U.S. and the rest of the planet, I am struck by how many aspects of the current political response mirrors what we experienced during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It was a scary, harrowing time and was made much worse by the abysmal response of President Reagan who, like Trump, put politics and prejudice ahead of public health. Then as now, this resulted in many more infections and deaths that could (and should) have been avoided. These similarities have led me to look back at how the gay and lesbian community responded more than three decades ago and at the effect that all that work had on the epidemic and on our country. While we have not eradicated HIV/AIDS, we did ultimately find treatments that today have allowed millions of people to live long lives even after infection (as long as they can afford it). It took years to find the right drugs and a herculean effort by thousands of professionals and volunteers to slow the spread of HIV. In the process, we learned many valuable lessons â€“ lessons that can be applied to the crisis at hand and help us navigate the coming days and months in our fight to overcome Covid â€“ 19. Here are some of the most salient: Testing is critical. Once the method of transmission was understood, an enormous effort was made to encourage anyone who had sexual contact with an infected person, gay men, hemophiliacs and IV drug users to get tested. In an effort to save lives, contacts of those who were positive were identified and also urged to get tested. This was the ONLY means of slowing the spread of the virus and without a doubt saved millions of lives. I would even go so far as to say that without all that effort by many people over many years, we may easily have seen the spread mirror most other parts of the world. There could have been just as large of an explosion of HIV in the general community in the U.S. People do sleep with each other all the time, after all. But HIV is much harder to transmit and the spread was much slower than what we dealing with now. In the face of the Corona virus, HIV looks like a luxury disease. This new pandemic is moving like wildfire because it does spread through a simple cough. We need to follow the guidance of Dr. Fauci and other medical and scientists (who gained their expertise through the HIV/AIDS epidemic) in every respect, including testing as many as possible as quickly as possible. Don't waste your time with conspiracy theories. In the early days of the HIV epidemic LaRouche was not the only one spreading conspiracy theories about its origin. There were rumors that some kind of bio warfare germ had been spread in gay bath houses in New York City and that this was the cause of the epidemic. I have heard similar theories about a bio-lab near Wuhan. With Corona-Virus, scientists have already traced its roots to a wet market where like HIV, it jumped from wild animals to humans. Regardless, It's a waste of time. It really doesn't matter if the conspiracy were true or not. Conspiracy theories are only about blaming someone else or worse, failing to take responsibility for what we can do today. All that matters is that we stop the spread as quickly as possible and that takes responsible, consistent action by all of us like staying home and using a mask. Once it sinks in, the numbers are overwhelming. I will never forget the day I heard Surgeon General C. Everett Koop present his report to the California Legislature. I had been invited to join a group of gay community leaders who were involved in lobbying for money for HIV testing and services for people with AIDS. The Surgeon General's speech was very progressive at the time because unlike Reagan, Koop refused to be silent. He put ideology aside and relied on his own medical experience and other professional health experts to guide his policy recommendations, including â€œa call to action for sex education and AIDS preventionâ€ [3] . As we sat in the balcony of the hall packed with legislators from across the state, he laid out his agenda for addressing the crisis. The speech was impressive and I was very moved, but what I remember the most was my reaction later. That night I flew home, walked into my kitchen and collapsed sobbing into the arms of my girlfriend. It took a few hours, but the gravity of Koop's message had sunk in. For the first time I understood that it was not just the dozens of friends and acquaintances I knew already. Many thousands of people were going to die. This is exactly the moment we are in now. This is what it means when they say we should prepare for the â€œworst week yet .â€ Thousands of people we all know and love are going to die. Prepare to grieve. We will lose plenty of talent. About 32 million people have died worldwide since the start of the AIDS epidemic and even more are living with it today. In the early years, we lost so many celebrities - Alvin Ailey, Isaac Asimov, Nureyev, Arthur Ashe â€“ and thousands of men and women who were not as famous, but touched so many lives around them. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the men I knew and loved â€“ many of them very talented leaders, artists, thinkers, athletes â€“ had survived. Yesterday I awoke to the news of John Prine's passing. He was one of the most influential songwriters of my childhood. My family's hippie church had a half dozen of his tunes in our songbook and we sang them religiously nearly every week. I immediately turned on YouTube and played an early video of him performing Souvenirs . I've been crying all morning. There are no â€œspecialâ€ people. It may be human nature to look for things that make us special. We want to identify with â€œwinnersâ€, â€œheroesâ€ and â€œgreatsâ€ and we assume that if they are special (as we wish to be) then they are immune. This is not the case. Yesterday the U.K.'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care. As a leader who doesn't believe in trusting experts and scientists, he ignored the warnings and failed to practice social distancing. In essence, he thought he was special and had the magical immunity that many right wing conservatives are still clinging to. The reality is that you may be able to affect politics and policy based on beliefs, but you cannot believe your way into immunity. Period. This week Baton Rouge Pastor Tony Spell told the Washington Post â€œWe feel we are being persecuted for the faith by being told to close our doors.â€ [4] I expect we will see a jump in deaths from churches like these and the communities around them where their followers may continue to ignore expert guidance. Christian evangelist fundamentalism is grounded in the belief that followers are â€œspecialâ€ because they have been saved. Every aspect of their belief system and politics flows from the idea that they have a unique relationship with God and a better understanding of what they (and all the rest of us) should do or not do. The same rhetoric was used against the gay community, Africans and African Americans to point the finger of responsibility back to the victims rather than expend resources saving lives. The same thing happened during the great plague in Europe. As millions were dying some people went to crazy lengths and joined religious cults in an attempt to be â€œspecialâ€ enough to save their lives. Large groups of Flagellants went from town to town lashing their backs bloody and whipping up townsfolk into a frenzy of religious fervor. It didn't help. More likely, the public gathering and blood letting only made things worse. Similar episodes are playing out online as well as in churches such as a Texas woman who died of Covid-19 last week. She was convinced that the epidemic was a â€œmedia-driven hoaxâ€ and had expressed her outrage on Facebook writing â€œ You don't need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!â€ [5] Her beliefs didn't save her but honest, fact-based reporting might have. Fear comes easily and often leads to violence. Little is more predictable these days than right-wing conservatives blaming a group of â€˜different' people for a crisis and then taking the first opportunity to attack them violently. Gay bashing nearly moved from the fringes to mainstream at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Now, thanks to our President's misdirection and use of the phrase â€œChinese Flu ,â€ violent attacks against Asian Americans have risen sharply. Absolutely everyone everywhere must speak out against this race-baiting. Not only is it unwarranted and inaccurate, but the very idea that a single ethnicity or group of people spread the virus will only cost more lives. I used to wonder at the insanity of these attacks since violently attacking people you think may be exposed increased the risk of exposure to their blood and thereby transmission. This time around, all you have to do is breathe. More importantly, it reinforces the idea that somehow if you could eliminate one group of people you could avoid becoming infected. This is not a group infection, it's a human disease. In fact it's just the kind of pandemic that climate change experts have been predicting for years. [6] If there is anyone to blame, it's all of us for not heading their warnings. This is exactly why we need more leaders like Surgeon General Koop who have the strength to put their political views aside and use the platform they have available to focus instead on spreading accurate information and saving lives. The enemy is the same â€“ conservative C hristians' deeply held belief in their superiority, white supremacy and a rejection of science. As mentioned above, conservative evangelicals believe that a â€˜special' event â€“ the experience of being born again â€“ sets them apart from others. They see themselves as superior because their religion's core message is that they are the â€˜chosen ones They are the few who will go to heaven when others who have not had the same enlightenment experience (or whom the bible says are sinners) will not. This is fundamental to their world view. It took me many years of living in the southern United States to understand how deep this belief in personal superiority is. For many people it is essential to their sense of self. This is especially true for white conservatives for whom their superior religious position is intertwined with their faith in white supremacy. This makes rejection of scientific inquiry not only easy, but essential. One must dismiss a lot of facts if you believe that the only way to get into heaven is to be superior in some way to other people. More to the point: if heaven is a zero sum game, then everyone else MUST loose. This is the kind of fundamentalism that both Bush presidencies were known for. Trump too built his following and then his presidential campaign on white supremacist conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace. This is where conservative Christianity and white supremacy meet because as soon as you reject facts in favor of personal superiority, the suffering of others does not matter. This world view is most dangerous at a time like this. It's not ignorance, it's the core belief among people who truly think that their faith will save them and even if they die, they are the only ones who will get to go to the right heaven. Leaders who ignore the facts can kill. Not every country experienced the explosion of the virus within the gay community or among IV drug users as in the U.S. There was always plenty of evidence that it was not a gay disease. However, it did start in Africa and spread quickly among straight populations on that continent and within the African American community. These facts served as the perfect combination for conservatives across the country (most notably President Bush) to leverage as a way to attack the victims and avoid providing resources. Millions of people were infected with HIV and died needlessly as a direct result of the stigma attached to AIDS in the United States. Today it is the same religious and political conservatives who are refusing to close their churches and insist that the Corona virus is a hoax. By doing so, they mirror policies like the Bush administration's ban against discussion of condoms and safe sex practices when distributing AIDS education funding. [7] It's been 30 years since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and today there are over 39 million people infected with HIV. [8] Yet HIV is so much more difficult to transmit than Covid-19. It is critical that good leaders who are willing to consider scientific facts and act on the advice of experts take the reins before we see the loss of millions people here and around the globe. Scientists are really smart, compassionate and they know what to do . There is good news in comparing the AIDS epidemic and Covid-19 Precisely because of the AIDS crisis, we have a national and global community of epidemiological experts with deep experience we can trust. This is an enormous advantage that did not exist in the 1980's. Doctor Fauci has emerged as a leader in recent weeks because he has the experience and expertise we so desperately need. It is also worth noting that because he started his career through HIV/AIDS work which makes him uniquely qualified to deal with leaders like those in the Trump administration who prefer their own story. He's seen this playbook before. Now Dr. Fauci is facing attacks from trolls and from within the administration. He needs all the help and support he can get if he is going to remain in his current role as a public health communicator. We need him to stay right where he is â€“ on our TV screens every day. Women will always rise to the challenge. There's an old joke that goes â€œAn army of ex-lovers cannot fail .â€ This was usually applied to the lesbian community due to our habit of maintaining friendships with old partners. During the height of the AIDS epidemic when virtually all of us were losing dozens of friends every year thousands of lesbians and other women joined their gay male friends and stepped up to care for our fallen. We fed and housed them, drove them to clinics and hospitals, sat by the bedside and made millions of phone calls in search of resources, filled out paperwork for friends too sick to get help. We too laid down in the streets in protest to fight for those services. As the Corona pandemic has impacted life around the world, women are carrying a great burden on all fronts â€“ as service workers, at home trying to work while parenting, in hospitals and nursing facilities where we make up 70% of medical staff, etc. [9] For women losing jobs or income, it's often harder to recover financially since our paychecks are smaller on average to start with. Once again, this crisis is highlighting the vulnerability of women and families in an economic system that undervalues our work and provides few safety nets. People of color will be hit bigger and harder. This is an issue that emerged early and still exists with new HIV/AIDS cases today. According to the CDC in 2018 there were nearly 30% more black vs. white men who contracted HIV through male to male contact. The percentage of heterosexual African American women vs. new cases among their white peers is even higher [10] . As the death toll from Covid-19 rises, the alarm bell is ringing once again because in many areas people of color are dying at a much higher rate [11] . This has everything to do with lack of access to healthcare, the funds to pay for it and higher rates of poverty. It is what happens when a group of people are undervalued and oppressed for generations. There is really no excuse for the fact that nearly forty years after the first American AIDS cases were identified such a glaring disparity should continue with either virus. We have to fightâ€¦ fight like hell on every front. It took a few years for people to organize in large numbers during the AIDS epidemic. When the first few dozen people died and it was clear that gay men were especially vulnerable, there were articles in the community press and whispers grew into larger conversations pretty quickly. But as dozens became hundreds and then thousands of people dying around the country the outcry from the gay and lesbian community was loud and consistent. We lobbied for health care and research funding from the CDC. We argued for testing, for clinics and to expedite trials for early experimental drugs like AZT. It was the AIDS crisis that brought some of us out of the closet and carried gay politics into the mainstream. We had no choice. We were dying and we were under attack by a right-wing political agenda that aggressively sought to silence our voices and marginalize the growing loss of life. Within the community there were roaring debates between different activists over strategy. Was it better to push for policy within the establishment and cultivate political allies or should we protest in the streets? â€œQueerâ€ was added to gay/lesbian during this period as a descriptor for our community by those who were outraged by the government's poor response to an epidemic that was killing us. Along with the ACT UP slogan â€œSilence = Deathâ€, calling ourselves queer was a way to say â€œWe're here! We are not going away and we are not going to hide!â€ We challenged politicians who held the purse strings to funds that were desperately needed to care for the sick and to find a cure. At that time I was working on policy and not always a fan of the â€œin your faceâ€ approach. In retrospect, however, the lesson is clear: we need all of it. It took all of us working inside traditional channels, building new organizations within the community and protesting in the streets to make the changes that had to happen if we were going to save lives. When we fight for the resources, we win. As I watch this new pandemic overtake our country, I am outraged. I see the same playbook being used to fragment our society at the very moment we need to pull together and support each other the most. But I am not disheartened. I have lived through this before and I know what is possible when we do stand up against lies and disinformation. Even with the loss of so many of our brothers and sisters, the gay and lesbian community grew stronger. We raised millions of dollars and built institutions that still serve us today. It can be done but action and activism is required â€” and there is no time to lose. This will change society. Over the course of about ten years, I watched it happen. Straight people who would never have admitted to having a gay brother or aunt began to speak of their loved ones more openly. Corporate leaders joined committees and boards for organizations dedicated to fighting AIDS and fundraisers grew along with a proliferation of red ribbons at the Oscars. In the long run, and at great cost, our fight to save our friends and lovers brought about a level of acceptance and integration into society that we hardly dared to dream of when I was first coming out in 1979. The legalization of gay marriage is one of the most dramatic examples of how far the will to fight for your lives can affect change. The question is what change do we want to see? What are we willing to fight for now that our lives are on the line? Elections Matter. Imagine if a democratic president like Jimmy Carter had still been in office when HIV hit the United States? What would the reaction of a humanitarian leader have been as compared to Ronald Reagan and what difference could it have made? Some democratic leaders are stronger than others. Some more or less compassionate. But remember that President Carter had the vision to put solar panels on top of the white house way back in 1979. Today his solar farm is providing half of the energy for his hometown in Georgia [12] . How would Hillary Clinton have responded to the corona virus crisis by now? Would she have ever made a statement like â€œ One day it's like a miracle, it will disappearâ€ [13] or threaten to withhold supplies and emergency funding from Governors â€œwho don't treat you right.â€ [14] ? This is not rhetoric. These are important questions because lives are on the line. For all of the weaknesses of the Democratic party, regardless of religion or one's political leanings, we all have to ask ourselves whether we can really afford to â€˜drain the swap' that is Washington D.C. of its institutions, intelligence and expertise. We are living with the results of decades in which the Republican southern strategy, aligned with conservative Christians and corporatocracy has succeeded in leaving the halls of our government so empty of experience, expertise and strong leadership that a man like Donald Trump was able to waltz right through the void and into the presidency. Now we are all paying the price, including the millions of human beings who live in the southern states and are now on the precipice of a health disaster unseen since World War I. Unlike the last flu pandemic, however, we know what to do. President Obama had left the country well prepared for another outbreak like this. Then Tr ump threw out the plans, the teams and even the department staff who were at the ready and could have helped our country avoid the enormous losses we are only beginning to see. This is why elections matter. By all accounts this week's v oting in Wisconsin is a pre-cursor of what is likely to come if Republican strategists continue to subvert the democratic process and suppress the vote in November. If we want to have any say in the direction our country takes during and after this epidemic, every American must be able to vote and every one who cares will have to work hard to ensure that all votes are counted. We are the moral majority. Why do we love disaster movies? I think it's because they are always about life and death situations that bring out the true character of the people involved. Until effective treatments were discovered HIV/AIDS was a monumental crisis in the United States and, of course for millions all over the world. We lost a nearly unimaginable number of people in a very short amount of time â€” people with whom we shared life and love, fun, pain and pride. It's impossible to measure what society as a whole lost in terms of talent, art, productivity, great leadership, literature, etc. But we also gained something of immense value. In the face of great loss, millions of Americans from all walks of life stood up. They rejected centuries of taboos and laws against homosexuality and declared their love for family, friends and colleagues they had lost to HIV/AIDS. They gave money, put on ribbons and talked freely about a beloved uncle who had previously been relegated to silent shadows on the family tree. We did so because we knew it was simply immoral not to. When we did, we found we were not alone and this made all the difference. We can do the same thing now. Despite what FOX News and the conservative voices would have you believe, progressive politics and liberal social views are still the majority. If this was not the case, Republicans would not work so hard to suppress voting rights. We know what to do and how to win. The only question is when. How many will die before we are ready to stand up, head into the streets and the board rooms and fight again? We lost many great people and important leaders through the AIDS epidemic. We are about to lose as many if not more with this new virus. This is both scary and heartbreaking. At the same time, we should remember that an entire generation of leaders cut their teeth on organizing as a result of the HIV/AIDS crisis and won many victories . We can also do this again. Many of those early organizers went on to pursue professional lives, built organizations and ran for office. They became doctors and healthcare workers and continued to make a difference in people's lives for over three decades. We don't have to start over again. Many of us are still around and have a wealth of experience and expertise to share. A final thought: One afternoon in the middle of the No on 64 campaign I was working in the Los Angeles headquarters when I overheard a conversation I will never forget. About half a dozen young gay men in their early 20's were busy stuffing envelopes around a couple of long tables in the middle of the office while I sat on the side working with a staff member on contribution reports. They came in on a bright, sunny Saturday to volunteer their time and energy to save lives and stop a terribly misguided piece of legislation. It could have put them all in camps within months if it had passed. Unlike myself, who tends to work too much and usually very seriously, these guys turned the whole place into a party. They gossiped and joked and laughed uproariously for a couple of hours while they worked. The Gay Pride Parade was just a week away, which prompted a wild discussion about the costumes they planned to wear, each more outrageous than the next. It was thoroughly entertaining and after a while I found myself deeply moved. I couldn't help but be struck by the way they laughed and played and chose to enjoy life even at such a dangerous time. In all likelihood, some of them were already HIV positive and could soon be sick or dying but that's not where they put their focus. Those beautiful men taught me one of the most important lessons I have ever learned that day. No matter what is happening or who is threatening to take us down, we must live and enjoy life. It's the most precious thing we have. It's worth fighting for. Â© 2020, KJ Miller | The opinions expressed here are mine and not those of my employer.

As a young labor organizer and a gay activist, I became a member of the steering committee that led the fight against California Proposition 64 in Los Angeles, a plan to put gay men and people with AIDS in camps. It was 1986. Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had become a tsunami in Africa and across the globe but was still largely ignored by Reagan administration. Unlike Africa and other continents where primarily heterosexual people were becoming infected, gay men and IV drug users were the first to be stricken in large numbers across the United States. The concentration of cases within these marginalized communities (quickly followed by a disproportionate number of deaths among African Americans and hemophiliacs) brought out the worst in conservative Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell [1] who were quick to blame the epidemic on its victims. President Reagan also allowed his prejudice to guide his response. For over four years he refused to even utter the word AIDS and ignored the cries of public health experts who urged him to take action and allocate resources to fight it. By the mid-eighties the LGBTQ community was under full-blown attack. While thousands of our friends and family were sick and dying Lyndon LaRouche, a right wing conspiracy theorist, seized the epidemic to promote himself politically. He ignored the solid research of established scientists that had determined HIV was spread by intimate contact with an infected person or their blood, claiming instead that the virus was spread through casual contact like the common cold and that the World Health Organization and the CDC were â€œviciously lying to the publicâ€ [2] . He then formed an organization he called PANIC -- "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" and paid people to gather signatures for a proposition to be put on the ballot in California. The result was Proposition 64 which would have mandated the creation of concentration camps for hundreds of thousands of gay men and people with HIV, including children. At a time when we were losing so many of our loved ones, this initiative forced the community to take action. We responded like never before and built a campaign that galvanized people across the state --gay and straight. By the end of the summer, we had succeeded in defeating LaRouche's initiative. I n the process, we developed a level of political power and organizing skill that helped build long-lasting community organizations and had a profound impact on our place in American society. As I have hunkered down in my home these last few weeks and watched the Corona Virus epidemic explode across the U.S. and the rest of the planet, I am struck by how many aspects of the current political response mirrors what we experienced during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It was a scary, harrowing time and was made much worse by the abysmal response of President Reagan who, like Trump, put politics and prejudice ahead of public health. Then as now, this resulted in many more infections and deaths that could (and should) have been avoided. These similarities have led me to look back at how the gay and lesbian community responded more than three decades ago and at the effect that all that work had on the epidemic and on our country. While we have not eradicated HIV/AIDS, we did ultimately find treatments that today have allowed millions of people to live long lives even after infection (as long as they can afford it). It took years to find the right drugs and a herculean effort by thousands of professionals and volunteers to slow the spread of HIV. In the process, we learned many valuable lessons â€“ lessons that can be applied to the crisis at hand and help us navigate the coming days and months in our fight to overcome Covid â€“ 19. Here are some of the most salient: Testing is critical. Once the method of transmission was understood, an enormous effort was made to encourage anyone who had sexual contact with an infected person, gay men, hemophiliacs and IV drug users to get tested. In an effort to save lives, contacts of those who were positive were identified and also urged to get tested. This was the ONLY means of slowing the spread of the virus and without a doubt saved millions of lives. I would even go so far as to say that without all that effort by many people over many years, we may easily have seen the spread mirror most other parts of the world. There could have been just as large of an explosion of HIV in the general community in the U.S. People do sleep with each other all the time, after all. But HIV is much harder to transmit and the spread was much slower than what we dealing with now. In the face of the Corona virus, HIV looks like a luxury disease. This new pandemic is moving like wildfire because it does spread through a simple cough. We need to follow the guidance of Dr. Fauci and other medical and scientists (who gained their expertise through the HIV/AIDS epidemic) in every respect, including testing as many as possible as quickly as possible. Don't waste your time with conspiracy theories. In the early days of the HIV epidemic LaRouche was not the only one spreading conspiracy theories about its origin. There were rumors that some kind of bio warfare germ had been spread in gay bath houses in New York City and that this was the cause of the epidemic. I have heard similar theories about a bio-lab near Wuhan. With Corona-Virus, scientists have already traced its roots to a wet market where like HIV, it jumped from wild animals to humans. Regardless, It's a waste of time. It really doesn't matter if the conspiracy were true or not. Conspiracy theories are only about blaming someone else or worse, failing to take responsibility for what we can do today. All that matters is that we stop the spread as quickly as possible and that takes responsible, consistent action by all of us like staying home and using a mask. Once it sinks in, the numbers are overwhelming. I will never forget the day I heard Surgeon General C. Everett Koop present his report to the California Legislature. I had been invited to join a group of gay community leaders who were involved in lobbying for money for HIV testing and services for people with AIDS. The Surgeon General's speech was very progressive at the time because unlike Reagan, Koop refused to be silent. He put ideology aside and relied on his own medical experience and other professional health experts to guide his policy recommendations, including â€œa call to action for sex education and AIDS preventionâ€ [3] . As we sat in the balcony of the hall packed with legislators from across the state, he laid out his agenda for addressing the crisis. The speech was impressive and I was very moved, but what I remember the most was my reaction later. That night I flew home, walked into my kitchen and collapsed sobbing into the arms of my girlfriend. It took a few hours, but the gravity of Koop's message had sunk in. For the first time I understood that it was not just the dozens of friends and acquaintances I knew already. Many thousands of people were going to die. This is exactly the moment we are in now. This is what it means when they say we should prepare for the â€œworst week yet .â€ Thousands of people we all know and love are going to die. Prepare to grieve. We will lose plenty of talent. About 32 million people have died worldwide since the start of the AIDS epidemic and even more are living with it today. In the early years, we lost so many celebrities - Alvin Ailey, Isaac Asimov, Nureyev, Arthur Ashe â€“ and thousands of men and women who were not as famous, but touched so many lives around them. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if the men I knew and loved â€“ many of them very talented leaders, artists, thinkers, athletes â€“ had survived. Yesterday I awoke to the news of John Prine's passing. He was one of the most influential songwriters of my childhood. My family's hippie church had a half dozen of his tunes in our songbook and we sang them religiously nearly every week. I immediately turned on YouTube and played an early video of him performing Souvenirs . I've been crying all morning. There are no â€œspecialâ€ people. It may be human nature to look for things that make us special. We want to identify with â€œwinnersâ€, â€œheroesâ€ and â€œgreatsâ€ and we assume that if they are special (as we wish to be) then they are immune. This is not the case. Yesterday the U.K.'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care. As a leader who doesn't believe in trusting experts and scientists, he ignored the warnings and failed to practice social distancing. In essence, he thought he was special and had the magical immunity that many right wing conservatives are still clinging to. The reality is that you may be able to affect politics and policy based on beliefs, but you cannot believe your way into immunity. Period. This week Baton Rouge Pastor Tony Spell told the Washington Post â€œWe feel we are being persecuted for the faith by being told to close our doors.â€ [4] I expect we will see a jump in deaths from churches like these and the communities around them where their followers may continue to ignore expert guidance. Christian evangelist fundamentalism is grounded in the belief that followers are â€œspecialâ€ because they have been saved. Every aspect of their belief system and politics flows from the idea that they have a unique relationship with God and a better understanding of what they (and all the rest of us) should do or not do. The same rhetoric was used against the gay community, Africans and African Americans to point the finger of responsibility back to the victims rather than expend resources saving lives. The same thing happened during the great plague in Europe. As millions were dying some people went to crazy lengths and joined religious cults in an attempt to be â€œspecialâ€ enough to save their lives. Large groups of Flagellants went from town to town lashing their backs bloody and whipping up townsfolk into a frenzy of religious fervor. It didn't help. More likely, the public gathering and blood letting only made things worse. Similar episodes are playing out online as well as in churches such as a Texas woman who died of Covid-19 last week. She was convinced that the epidemic was a â€œmedia-driven hoaxâ€ and had expressed her outrage on Facebook writing â€œ You don't need hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and Lysol. You need common sense, a sense of direction, faith, a will to fight, and of course guns!â€ [5] Her beliefs didn't save her but honest, fact-based reporting might have. Fear comes easily and often leads to violence. Little is more predictable these days than right-wing conservatives blaming a group of â€˜different' people for a crisis and then taking the first opportunity to attack them violently. Gay bashing nearly moved from the fringes to mainstream at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Now, thanks to our President's misdirection and use of the phrase â€œChinese Flu ,â€ violent attacks against Asian Americans have risen sharply. Absolutely everyone everywhere must speak out against this race-baiting. Not only is it unwarranted and inaccurate, but the very idea that a single ethnicity or group of people spread the virus will only cost more lives. I used to wonder at the insanity of these attacks since violently attacking people you think may be exposed increased the risk of exposure to their blood and thereby transmission. This time around, all you have to do is breathe. More importantly, it reinforces the idea that somehow if you could eliminate one group of people you could avoid becoming infected. This is not a group infection, it's a human disease. In fact it's just the kind of pandemic that climate change experts have been predicting for years. [6] If there is anyone to blame, it's all of us for not heading their warnings. This is exactly why we need more leaders like Surgeon General Koop who have the strength to put their political views aside and use the platform they have available to focus instead on spreading accurate information and saving lives. The enemy is the same â€“ conservative C hristians' deeply held belief in their superiority, white supremacy and a rejection of science. As mentioned above, conservative evangelicals believe that a â€˜special' event â€“ the experience of being born again â€“ sets them apart from others. They see themselves as superior because their religion's core message is that they are the â€˜chosen ones They are the few who will go to heaven when others who have not had the same enlightenment experience (or whom the bible says are sinners) will not. This is fundamental to their world view. It took me many years of living in the southern United States to understand how deep this belief in personal superiority is. For many people it is essential to their sense of self. This is especially true for white conservatives for whom their superior religious position is intertwined with their faith in white supremacy. This makes rejection of scientific inquiry not only easy, but essential. One must dismiss a lot of facts if you believe that the only way to get into heaven is to be superior in some way to other people. More to the point: if heaven is a zero sum game, then everyone else MUST loose. This is the kind of fundamentalism that both Bush presidencies were known for. Trump too built his following and then his presidential campaign on white supremacist conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace. This is where conservative Christianity and white supremacy meet because as soon as you reject facts in favor of personal superiority, the suffering of others does not matter. This world view is most dangerous at a time like this. It's not ignorance, it's the core belief among people who truly think that their faith will save them and even if they die, they are the only ones who will get to go to the right heaven. Leaders who ignore the facts can kill. Not every country experienced the explosion of the virus within the gay community or among IV drug users as in the U.S. There was always plenty of evidence that it was not a gay disease. However, it did start in Africa and spread quickly among straight populations on that continent and within the African American community. These facts served as the perfect combination for conservatives across the country (most notably President Bush) to leverage as a way to attack the victims and avoid providing resources. Millions of people were infected with HIV and died needlessly as a direct result of the stigma attached to AIDS in the United States. Today it is the same religious and political conservatives who are refusing to close their churches and insist that the Corona virus is a hoax. By doing so, they mirror policies like the Bush administration's ban against discussion of condoms and safe sex practices when distributing AIDS education funding. [7] It's been 30 years since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and today there are over 39 million people infected with HIV. [8] Yet HIV is so much more difficult to transmit than Covid-19. It is critical that good leaders who are willing to consider scientific facts and act on the advice of experts take the reins before we see the loss of millions people here and around the globe. Scientists are really smart, compassionate and they know what to do . There is good news in comparing the AIDS epidemic and Covid-19 Precisely because of the AIDS crisis, we have a national and global community of epidemiological experts with deep experience we can trust. This is an enormous advantage that did not exist in the 1980's. Doctor Fauci has emerged as a leader in recent weeks because he has the experience and expertise we so desperately need. It is also worth noting that because he started his career through HIV/AIDS work which makes him uniquely qualified to deal with leaders like those in the Trump administration who prefer their own story. He's seen this playbook before. Now Dr. Fauci is facing attacks from trolls and from within the administration. He needs all the help and support he can get if he is going to remain in his current role as a public health communicator. We need him to stay right where he is â€“ on our TV screens every day. Women will always rise to the challenge. There's an old joke that goes â€œAn army of ex-lovers cannot fail .â€ This was usually applied to the lesbian community due to our habit of maintaining friendships with old partners. During the height of the AIDS epidemic when virtually all of us were losing dozens of friends every year thousands of lesbians and other women joined their gay male friends and stepped up to care for our fallen. We fed and housed them, drove them to clinics and hospitals, sat by the bedside and made millions of phone calls in search of resources, filled out paperwork for friends too sick to get help. We too laid down in the streets in protest to fight for those services. As the Corona pandemic has impacted life around the world, women are carrying a great burden on all fronts â€“ as service workers, at home trying to work while parenting, in hospitals and nursing facilities where we make up 70% of medical staff, etc. [9] For women losing jobs or income, it's often harder to recover financially since our paychecks are smaller on average to start with. Once again, this crisis is highlighting the vulnerability of women and families in an economic system that undervalues our work and provides few safety nets. People of color will be hit bigger and harder. This is an issue that emerged early and still exists with new HIV/AIDS cases today. According to the CDC in 2018 there were nearly 30% more black vs. white men who contracted HIV through male to male contact. The percentage of heterosexual African American women vs. new cases among their white peers is even higher [10] . As the death toll from Covid-19 rises, the alarm bell is ringing once again because in many areas people of color are dying at a much higher rate [11] . This has everything to do with lack of access to healthcare, the funds to pay for it and higher rates of poverty. It is what happens when a group of people are undervalued and oppressed for generations. There is really no excuse for the fact that nearly forty years after the first American AIDS cases were identified such a glaring disparity should continue with either virus. We have to fightâ€¦ fight like hell on every front. It took a few years for people to organize in large numbers during the AIDS epidemic. When the first few dozen people died and it was clear that gay men were especially vulnerable, there were articles in the community press and whispers grew into larger conversations pretty quickly. But as dozens became hundreds and then thousands of people dying around the country the outcry from the gay and lesbian community was loud and consistent. We lobbied for health care and research funding from the CDC. We argued for testing, for clinics and to expedite trials for early experimental drugs like AZT. It was the AIDS crisis that brought some of us out of the closet and carried gay politics into the mainstream. We had no choice. We were dying and we were under attack by a right-wing political agenda that aggressively sought to silence our voices and marginalize the growing loss of life. Within the community there were roaring debates between different activists over strategy. Was it better to push for policy within the establishment and cultivate political allies or should we protest in the streets? â€œQueerâ€ was added to gay/lesbian during this period as a descriptor for our community by those who were outraged by the government's poor response to an epidemic that was killing us. Along with the ACT UP slogan â€œSilence = Deathâ€, calling ourselves queer was a way to say â€œWe're here! We are not going away and we are not going to hide!â€ We challenged politicians who held the purse strings to funds that were desperately needed to care for the sick and to find a cure. At that time I was working on policy and not always a fan of the â€œin your faceâ€ approach. In retrospect, however, the lesson is clear: we need all of it. It took all of us working inside traditional channels, building new organizations within the community and protesting in the streets to make the changes that had to happen if we were going to save lives. When we fight for the resources, we win. As I watch this new pandemic overtake our country, I am outraged. I see the same playbook being used to fragment our society at the very moment we need to pull together and support each other the most. But I am not disheartened. I have lived through this before and I know what is possible when we do stand up against lies and disinformation. Even with the loss of so many of our brothers and sisters, the gay and lesbian community grew stronger. We raised millions of dollars and built institutions that still serve us today. It can be done but action and activism is required â€” and there is no time to lose. This will change society. Over the course of about ten years, I watched it happen. Straight people who would never have admitted to having a gay brother or aunt began to speak of their loved ones more openly. Corporate leaders joined committees and boards for organizations dedicated to fighting AIDS and fundraisers grew along with a proliferation of red ribbons at the Oscars. In the long run, and at great cost, our fight to save our friends and lovers brought about a level of acceptance and integration into society that we hardly dared to dream of when I was first coming out in 1979. The legalization of gay marriage is one of the most dramatic examples of how far the will to fight for your lives can affect change. The question is what change do we want to see? What are we willing to fight for now that our lives are on the line? Elections Matter. Imagine if a democratic president like Jimmy Carter had still been in office when HIV hit the United States? What would the reaction of a humanitarian leader have been as compared to Ronald Reagan and what difference could it have made? Some democratic leaders are stronger than others. Some more or less compassionate. But remember that President Carter had the vision to put solar panels on top of the white house way back in 1979. Today his solar farm is providing half of the energy for his hometown in Georgia [12] . How would Hillary Clinton have responded to the corona virus crisis by now? Would she have ever made a statement like â€œ One day it's like a miracle, it will disappearâ€ [13] or threaten to withhold supplies and emergency funding from Governors â€œwho don't treat you right.â€ [14] ? This is not rhetoric. These are important questions because lives are on the line. For all of the weaknesses of the Democratic party, regardless of religion or one's political leanings, we all have to ask ourselves whether we can really afford to â€˜drain the swap' that is Washington D.C. of its institutions, intelligence and expertise. We are living with the results of decades in which the Republican southern strategy, aligned with conservative Christians and corporatocracy has succeeded in leaving the halls of our government so empty of experience, expertise and strong leadership that a man like Donald Trump was able to waltz right through the void and into the presidency. Now we are all paying the price, including the millions of human beings who live in the southern states and are now on the precipice of a health disaster unseen since World War I. Unlike the last flu pandemic, however, we know what to do. President Obama had left the country well prepared for another outbreak like this. Then Tr ump threw out the plans, the teams and even the department staff who were at the ready and could have helped our country avoid the enormous losses we are only beginning to see. This is why elections matter. By all accounts this week's v oting in Wisconsin is a pre-cursor of what is likely to come if Republican strategists continue to subvert the democratic process and suppress the vote in November. If we want to have any say in the direction our country takes during and after this epidemic, every American must be able to vote and every one who cares will have to work hard to ensure that all votes are counted. We are the moral majority. Why do we love disaster movies? I think it's because they are always about life and death situations that bring out the true character of the people involved. Until effective treatments were discovered HIV/AIDS was a monumental crisis in the United States and, of course for millions all over the world. We lost a nearly unimaginable number of people in a very short amount of time â€” people with whom we shared life and love, fun, pain and pride. It's impossible to measure what society as a whole lost in terms of talent, art, productivity, great leadership, literature, etc. But we also gained something of immense value. In the face of great loss, millions of Americans from all walks of life stood up. They rejected centuries of taboos and laws against homosexuality and declared their love for family, friends and colleagues they had lost to HIV/AIDS. They gave money, put on ribbons and talked freely about a beloved uncle who had previously been relegated to silent shadows on the family tree. We did so because we knew it was simply immoral not to. When we did, we found we were not alone and this made all the difference. We can do the same thing now. Despite what FOX News and the conservative voices would have you believe, progressive politics and liberal social views are still the majority. If this was not the case, Republicans would not work so hard to suppress voting rights. We know what to do and how to win. The only question is when. How many will die before we are ready to stand up, head into the streets and the board rooms and fight again? We lost many great people and important leaders through the AIDS epidemic. We are about to lose as many if not more with this new virus. This is both scary and heartbreaking. At the same time, we should remember that an entire generation of leaders cut their teeth on organizing as a result of the HIV/AIDS crisis and won many victories . We can also do this again. Many of those early organizers went on to pursue professional lives, built organizations and ran for office. They became doctors and healthcare workers and continued to make a difference in people's lives for over three decades. We don't have to start over again. Many of us are still around and have a wealth of experience and expertise to share. A final thought: One afternoon in the middle of the No on 64 campaign I was working in the Los Angeles headquarters when I overheard a conversation I will never forget. About half a dozen young gay men in their early 20's were busy stuffing envelopes around a couple of long tables in the middle of the office while I sat on the side working with a staff member on contribution reports. They came in on a bright, sunny Saturday to volunteer their time and energy to save lives and stop a terribly misguided piece of legislation. It could have put them all in camps within months if it had passed. Unlike myself, who tends to work too much and usually very seriously, these guys turned the whole place into a party. They gossiped and joked and laughed uproariously for a couple of hours while they worked. The Gay Pride Parade was just a week away, which prompted a wild discussion about the costumes they planned to wear, each more outrageous than the next. It was thoroughly entertaining and after a while I found myself deeply moved. I couldn't help but be struck by the way they laughed and played and chose to enjoy life even at such a dangerous time. In all likelihood, some of them were already HIV positive and could soon be sick or dying but that's not where they put their focus. Those beautiful men taught me one of the most important lessons I have ever learned that day. No matter what is happening or who is threatening to take us down, we must live and enjoy life. It's the most precious thing we have. It's worth fighting for. Â© 2020, KJ Miller | The opinions expressed here are mine and not those of my employer.

As I write this, Iâ€˜m in the midst of the daily routine of watching Governor Cuomoâ€™s daily briefing. I guess people in other parts of the country watch the President, but here in NY I think Mayor DeBlasio and Governor Cuomo are both getting more attention. I was never a big fan of the gov, but his leadership, messaging, and humanity have been exemplary. He is clearly at his best in a crisis. Which is good, because things are still scary. The death toll in New York State over the past week far exceeds the 2,753 souls lost on 9/11. For those of us who lived through that time and lost friends and loved ones, the COVID-19 numbers â€” over 7,000 deaths in NY so far â€” seem unimaginable. The continued challenge is to use social distancing to keep the number of cases under the capacity of the healthcare system; as of today, itâ€™s still a crap shoot. The good news is that the hospitalization rate in NYC seems to be slowing, but outside of the city it is still gathering steam. Iâ€™m about 150 miles north of the epicenter. In my mostly suburban/rural county we have had roughly 100 declared cases and five deaths. Compliance with distancing seems to be good, with few cars on the road, people wearing masks and gloves, etc. Personally, I have been going out no more than once a week, usually to the local grocery store. My wife and I go at 8:00 PM (they close at 9:00) and itâ€™s generally pretty well stocked except for pasta, toilet paper and Lysol. Fortunately I had gone to the big-box store a while ago, so we had a large inventory of paper products before the panic buying started. Mostly, I have been amusing myself by searching EBay and finding stuff for Tod to buy .

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WIAT ) â€” As more cases of COVID-19 are confirmed, the chances of living with someone who may have the virus increase. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that if that happens, itâ€™s important the person that is sick stays in a separate room and uses a separate bathroom. The CDC recommends leaving cleaning supplies for the sick person and have them eat in a different room. When it comes to cleaning, the CDC recommends soap and water first and then top off with a disinfectant. You should be tackling the common areas such as sinks, faucets, light switches, doorknobs and other areas youâ€™re constantly touching. Tracy Shelnutt, territory manager for Two Maids and a Mop in Birmingham, said they donâ€™t recommend bleach because it can be a harmful chemical. Instead, they recommend a 99% disinfectant. They also say to clean several times a day. â€œMake yourself a little list so that you know where you left off the day before to keep things disinfected. And every day when I go home, I take my clothes off in our mudroom and put it in the laundry,â€ Shelnutt said. â€œI use Lysol and spray the doorknobs, light switches â€” places weâ€™re touching every single day.â€ Shelnutt said itâ€™s important to also make sure to clean the electronics, especially now that the kids are home. Those items should be your phone, TV remotes, laptops, keyboards and anything that is being touched every day. For a full list from CDC on how to clean your home when someone is sick, click here.

Comfort items donated for the medical staff and patients. (Courtesy Photo) Stony Brook University Hospital launched its Coronavirus (COVID-19) donation program on March 20 and the response from the Long Island community has been overwhelming. The donation response team is being led by Joan Dickinson, Director of Stony Brook University Community Relations; Colby Rowe, Stony Brook Medicine Trauma Center Educator and EMS Outreach Coordinator; and Scott LaMarsh, Building Manager for the Charles B. Wang Center. The group and their team have been connecting with donors, arranging donations and shipments, organizing the materials, and finally, dispensing the items. "It's been great to see the community come together. These donations are more than a great support for the hospital; they empower donors to be part of the solution," said Joan Dickinson, Stony Brook University Community Relations Director. During a two-week period, the donation response teams received 2,200 emails, 415 donor phone calls, and 275 video messages, which led to 140 scheduled donation drop offs and receiving 50 shipments of materials. Through the outpouring of support, the Hospital procured 201,959 pieces of PPE - including N95 3M 1860 masks and other masks, protective eyewear, goggles, gloves, and face shields, including 3D-printed frames, 4,793 comfort care items, 232 iPads, 65 food deliveries, and equipment, including ventilators. Comfort care items donated for staff included food through the SBUH Meal Train, water and beverages; hand lotion, dry shampoo, tissue packs, antibacterial wipes, Chapstick; liquid hand soap (pump jars/bottles preferred), hand sanitizer, Lysol and Clorox wipes; snacks, gum, candy, cough drops; stress balls, fidget spinners, aromatherapy masks; and video messages of support, while comfort care items for patients encompassed items such as puzzles, coloring pages and pencils; blank books and pens; socks, earplugs, sleep masks; notebooks, pens, pencils, and sharpeners. The donation drive will continue through at least April. And the community isn't the only ones answering the call to action. Stony Brook University's iCreate Lab has been busy assembling hundreds of 3D-printed face shields. So far, 1,600 have been delivered to the Hospital. The Department of Chemistry has also joined the efforts, producing nearly 100 gallons of hand sanitizer for campus use. All donation drop offs must be scheduled in advance. To do so, contact Joan Dickinson at COVID19donations@stonybrook.edu or call 631-219-0603. Nicole is the Editor-in-Chief of Hamptons.com where she focuses on lifestyle, nightlife, and mixology.

Dems being classy......again. Quote:New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski on Thursday fantasized about withholding disinfectants from Kentuckians in order to strong arm Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Coronavirus bill. Malinowski is your typical Democrat thug. The Coronavirus pandemic is sweeping across the US and the CDC is instructing Americans to be extra vigilant by cleaning and disinfecting their hands and homes in order to reduce the risk of getting infected by COVID-19, but Democrat Malinowski is fantasizing about sticking it to Kentuckians. The National Republican Congressional Committee blasted Democrat Malinowski. â€œWhile Americans are putting their political differences aside to work together, @Malinowski admitted heâ€™s fantasized about withholding Coronavirus-killing disinfectants from Kentuckians to stick it to Mitch McConnell,â€ the NRCC said. â€œFun fact about Somerset County, uh, we make 100% of the national supply of Lysol disinfectant,â€ Malinowski said on a video conference call. â€œI thought about using that with, like, Mitch McConnell â€” like hey, you know, weâ€™re gonna hold up the Lysol to Kentucky until you pass ourâ€¦bill,â€ Malinowski said. Many people on the conference call gave a â€˜thumbs upâ€™ in support of Malinowskiâ€™s disgusting fantasy. â€œBut you know thatâ€™s a fantasy that I donâ€™t thinkâ€¦ itâ€™s not going to work that way,â€ he said.

Even if you've never struggled with disordered eating before, having to stay home can be a real challenge in managing your mental health as it relates to your body image. These are unprecedented times in almost every possible way. One is the complete upheaval of absolutely everything about your daily routines, including the space you live in and how you're able to move around in it each day. Another is the amount you spend within staring distance of a mirror. For people with eating disorders, and even those who have never struggled with disordered eating before, these things can compound into a real challenge in managing mental health when it comes to their bodies. â€œItâ€™s kind of like the perfect storm, whatâ€™s happening when youâ€™re isolated,â€ said Mayo Clinic psychologist Leslie Sim, who specializes in eating disorders and body image issues. â€œThere are just millions of variables that make body image preoccupation a lot higher.â€ Those variables include the fact that thereâ€™s so much time to fixate onâ€¦ anything you feel stress about right now, including your ever-present flesh vessel. On top of that, so many strategies mental health experts would normally recommend to manage negative feelings about our bodies aren't possible when youâ€™re trying to stay in the house, away from people. â€œEverything around eating or prepping food right now creates additional stressors that we just havenâ€™t seen in the past,â€ said Dani Gonzales, a staff psychologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California. â€œHow do I even get to the grocery store safely? How do I sanitize my groceries?â€ If youâ€™ve noticed self-isolation is making you feel shittier than usual about your body, experts say youâ€™re very much not alone. (Asked if USC students and those she works with in her private practice are struggling with this, Gonzales responded, â€œAbsolutely.â€) But there are still ways you can manage negative feelings about your body, even in our isolated times. Here are some ideas about how to adapt if your usual coping strategies aren't available to you. (Note that these tips are meant to support, not stand in for, effective mental and physical health care from experts. If you have access to a mental health or eating disorder professional, even in a virtual or video capacity, thatâ€™s the best way to find help. The National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) has a roundup of low-cost and free support options, as well.) Unfollow whatâ€™s unhelpful. Mid-April can be stressful in a normal year, body-image-wise, especially online. As if the perennial Instagram posts quietly pushing you to sculpt a "beach body" werenâ€™t enough, how about a little pandemic pressure on top of it? Instagram, especially and as ever, is full of diet and exercise advice. But those accounts might not belong to qualified health and wellness professionals, and even if they do, you could be watching fitness videos that were recorded long before COVID. Those people might have been in a very different placeâ€”like â€œable to leave the houseâ€â€”at the time, so itâ€™s not a standard you can reasonably hold yourself to. And, OK, say they are qualified professionals. Is watching folks who stay #cut for a living do squats really beneficial for you, right now? Or is it making you feel worse? â€œWith body image, a lot of it comes with social comparison,"said Gonzales, who offered an alternative approach to how isolation could impact that thinking."Having to be more isolated, maybe itâ€™s not in our face as much, comparing our bodies to others.â€ In other words, â€œIt might be a good time to limit or disengageâ€ from Instagram and Facebook a little. Enjoy social (distance) meals. Missing your classmates or colleagues at the old lunch table by now? Even the guy whoâ€™s still talking about the Game of Thrones finale? Thatâ€™s totally reasonableâ€”studies have shown that people are happier and healthier when we eat meals together. â€œ Research says that loneliness is a strong predictor of disordered eating,â€ Sim said. â€œ Feeling disconnected from others can make us focus more on body image.â€ Youâ€™ve probably already been using video platforms for work meetings and happy hoursâ€”to counter loneliness's potential effects on your body image, add a midday social meal into the mix, too. â€œEating socially can be an effective way for us to check-in with our bodies, feel connected to others, pair eating with other pleasurable events, like listening and laughing, and help bring routine to our lives during these hectic times,â€ Gonzales said. Social meals can also provide structure, which so many of us are seeking in this chaotic time. According to Gonzales, one helpful way to eat mindfully, respecting our hunger and fullness cues, is to eat as close to a schedule as possible. â€œWhen we start to deviate from schedules or skip meals we can run the risk of restricting, binging, or eating in the absence of hunger,â€ she said. â€œMaybe you schedule a Zoom lunch, where you have a few of your friends and youâ€™re all eating together,â€ Gonzales said. â€œThat might normalize: We eat at scheduled times.â€ Appreciate that your body can still do a lot of cool stuff and try to experience that in new ways. OK, so the gym is closed. You probably donâ€™t have access to the trainers and programs you like in the way you're used to. That sucks. If you crave physical activity and Zoom fitness classes just arenâ€™t cutting it, try to find new outlets for engaging your body that work for you. Maybe you could try a yoga program? Download Zwift and take virtual bike rides with your buds? Gonzales and Sim said it can also be helpful to reframe a focus on fitness as â€œwhat can my body doâ€ versus â€œhow should my body look.â€ Gonzales framed the thought as asking yourself, â€œ How can I experience my body in different ways?â€ Even a new hobby counts when it comes to bodily appreciationâ€”think about how your body helps you write letters, or move when you take a walk, orâ€¦ even when you do boring stuff like vacuuming or weeding the garden. Gonzales put it like this: Your body is â€œan instrument, more so than an ornament.â€ Try to remember that. â€œThat bit of creativityâ€”the characteristic of resilience and survivalâ€”can be adaptable now.â€ Gonzales said. One of her clients recently shared that pandemic downtime is letting her get creative with her body image while at homeâ€”being more artistic with makeup, styling hair in new ways, putting together outfits, and organizing her closet to directly oppose negative thoughts about her body image and shape. Remember that this isn't forever, and that you might need to allow yourself some room right now. â€œI would love for people to get the message: Itâ€™s OK,â€ Gonzales said. â€œItâ€™s OK if maybe weâ€™re not enjoying our bodies, or how weâ€™re eating, or these times. This isnâ€™t forever, even if it may feel like it from day to day.â€ It comes down to practicing self-compassion. Which, great. But how does oneâ€¦ do that? Should we engage with our not-good thoughts? Block them out? The answer is: kind of both. Sim suggested observing your judgemental thoughts, without necessarily listening to them. Itâ€™s not easy! But think about yourself like youâ€™d think about a friend. If they gained or lost some weight, that wouldnâ€™t change your opinion of them, right? And if they were feeling bad about themselves, youâ€™d build them up, rather than indulging their shame spiral, right? In this case, you are your friend. Try to be kind, warm, accepting of where youâ€™re at. Ask yourself: What does your body need? Is it sleep? Space? Kindness? Water? Let that guide you. â€œAllowing our needs to be met during these times can be so crucial, versus turning to our bodies and making them the enemy,â€ Gonzales added. Take advantage of online resources. For additional support, Gonzales pointed again to the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), which, she said, is, â€œbased in academic research, but great at connecting with peopleâ€â€”as in: They meet you where youâ€™re at and talk to you like a human person, not a textbook. NEDA recognizes that isolation is causing a lot of people a lot of stress when it comes to their bodiesâ€”so much so that upon visiting their website, youâ€™re greeted by a pop-up linking to a specific COVID-19 resource page developed for those who are struggling. NEDA assembled a list of virtual support groups and created a COVID-specific forum thatâ€™s open and monitored 24/7. The organization also launched a new NEDA Connections video series with daily check-ins, activities, and presentations from professionals. NEDA links to @covid19eatingsupport as one helpful Instagram account to follow, which hosts hourly Instagram Live sessions with dietitians, nutritionists, and therapists and other ED specialists. Between the whole global pandemic, economic collapse, and, ya know, end of the world as we know it, thereâ€™s enough to worry about already. But you're not vain or selfish for struggling with this. Lots of people, globally, are going through this and trying to manage some of the same preoccupations you are. However you can take steps toward easing up on yourself, even if it takes time and doesn't happen right away: Give yourself, and your body, a break. Follow Emily Cassel on Twitter.

If youâ€™re trying to stay safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic, youâ€™re probably doing more chores now than you did two months ago. When it comes to disinfecting your space, bleach is a great optionâ€”itâ€™s inexpensive, tried and true, and gets the job done. If you have long considered yourself kind of a dirtbag, you might be looking at bleach with trepidationâ€”like, Isn't it poison? On the other end of the spectrum, there are some alarming signs of perhaps somewhatâ€¦ misguided confidence, based in the idea that bleach is so basic, you definitely donâ€™t need to bother reading the instructions carefully. Neither point of view is anything to be ashamed of. Iâ€™m a generally clean person who wears a ton of white clothing, and even I find bleach intimidating and also sometimes do not totally respect its power. If youâ€™ve spent the last month kind of wondering what, exactly, bleach even is, or suspect you donâ€™t know, exactly, how to use it safely and responsibly, youâ€™ve come to the right place. Here is your ultimate guide to the very basic-feeling, very complex-feeling, cleaning agent that can serve as something of a saving grace right nowâ€”once you come to truly understand it. (First, a quick note: If you or someone you live with is even a little bit sick, or if you have to go out into the world regularly, you should use the CDCâ€™s guidelines for disinfecting households with people isolated in home care as your main resource.) Learn the bleach basics. When disinfecting your home, youâ€™re likely going to be dealing with chlorine bleach, which is often referred to as household bleach. The active ingredient in chlorine bleach is sodium hypochlorite, usually at a concentration of 5.25 or 6 percent. (â€œOxygen bleach,â€ on the other hand, contains sodium percarbonate. It often shows up as a â€œbleach alternative,â€ â€œcolor-safe bleach,â€ or stain remover by brands like OxiClean and Tide. And FYI, you should not use any sodium percarbonate laundry products for disinfecting surfaces during this pandemic, or ever.) If youâ€™re using chlorine bleachâ€”like a straight-up, old-school bottle of Cloroxâ€”you need to prepare a bleach solution by diluting the bleach in water. The specific ratio will be on the product label, but, in general, you can expect to add â…“-cup (or five tablespoons) of bleach to every gallon of water. (If you want to make less solution, you can do four teaspoons of bleach for each quart of water.) The Clorox website advises making a fresh bleach solution every day, so if you donâ€™t have a lot of chores to do, you might want to go with the quart mixture. Once youâ€™ve made the bleach solution, you can transfer it to a spray bottle that you label, very clearly and unmistakably, â€œBLEACH SOLUTION,â€ then spray it on surfaces to disinfect them. You can also pour a little bit of the bleach solution into a bowl or empty Tupperware container, dip a rag or cloth into it to get it wet, then use that to wipe surfaces. If you go that route, make a point to refill the smaller container with fresh bleach solution and get a new rag when going between different surfaces (like, say, the bathroom toilet to the bathroom sink). You can buy premixed bleach solutions that are ready to use and donâ€™t need to be diluted further. Those will typically come in a spray bottle and have something like â€œmulti-purpose cleaner with bleachâ€ in the name. Itâ€™s really, really not OK to mix bleach with any other cleaning products. Iâ€™m sorry to give you another chore at a time like this, but reading the fine print of the ingredients lists on all of your cleaning products is an extremely wise move. Ammonia is public enemy #1 hereâ€”when mixed with bleach, it produces a toxic gas that can make you very sick and possibly kill you. You probably know this, but you might not know just how common ammonia is. It shows up in a lot of products, including window and glass cleaners, toilet-bowl cleaners, and all-purpose cleaners. Ammonia is also the main ingredient in a lot of disinfecting wipes. All of the Lysol, Clorox, and generic wipes Iâ€™ve used over the past month are actually ammonia-based, which was... a surprise to me. Make a point to read labels carefully, and look up the specific product on the manufacturerâ€™s website if youâ€™re not sure whatâ€™s in it. Do not, under any circumstances, wash your produce with bleachâ€”not even â€œa little.â€ Cleaning fruits and vegetables with bleach is unequivocally a bad ideaâ€”itâ€™s neither necessary nor safe. This is an instance where â€œI know itâ€™s probably overkill, but Iâ€™m just doing it for my own peace of mind!!!â€ does not apply. Bleach isnâ€™t a placebo. itâ€™s literal poison. Do not do this. Itâ€™s also not safe (or necessary!!!) to wash produce with soap and water. Do not do this, either. I hesitate to go into further detail, because it should seem obvious, but don't eat soap. You should wash all produce before eating it, even if you plan to peel it first. (And thatâ€™s true even in non-pandemic times!) According to Cheryl Mendelson, author of the exhaustive housekeeping encyclopedia Home Comforts, all you need is running water, patience, and your own (clean!) hands. Hereâ€™s how to safely and properly get the job done: Remove any outer leaves. Wash hard-skinned produce, like apples and cucumbers, by scrubbing them vigorously under a strong stream of cold water from the tap. If you have a clean vegetable brush, use that (along with a hard stream of cold water) to scrub root vegetables, like potatoes and carrots. The brush will help you get all of the dirt out of the little ridges. Wash soft produce, like berries and lettuce, in the strongest stream of cold water they can handle. (If the produce is beginning to get mashed or torn, turn the water down a bit.) You can also put them in a colander and run cold water over them while gently agitating them or turning them over. Take your time when washing fruits and veggies. Much like proper hand washing canâ€™t be done in five seconds, neither can proper produce washing. If youâ€™re trying to disinfect a dirty surface, you need to thoroughly clean it with soap and water before you hit it with bleach. *pushes glasses up nose* I apologize for being pedantic, but there is a difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting, and the distinction matters. According to the CDC and EPA, â€œcleaningâ€ refers to removing germs, dirt, grease, and other impurities from surfaces. Cleaning doesnâ€™t kill germsâ€”it simply removes them, thus lowering their overall numbers and the risk of infection. â€œSanitizingâ€ and â€œdisinfectingâ€ both refer to using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. Sanitizing means killing most germs, while disinfecting means killing basically all of them. Disinfecting is what we're aiming for in the context of the coronavirus, and what the bleach is for. The thing is, disinfecting isnâ€™t really going to be possible if the surface itself is still dirty. Letâ€™s say you want to kill any gross stuff that may be clinging to the Crocs you wore when you took your dog outside this morning. If thereâ€™s a big chunk of mud on the sole, you need to clean that off first (e.g., hit the shoe with a wet, soapy paper towel and rinse it with water). Once the mud is gone, then you can clean the shoe with a bleach cleaner or other disinfectant. Remember: If you use a cleaning product other than soap and water before disinfecting, make absolutely sure it doesnâ€™t have any ingredients that could mix with the bleach and become lethal. By the way: Mendelson says that a bleach solution (so, bleach dissolved in water) is the best option for food-contact surfaces, like utensils, plates, or cutting boards. For surfaces that wonâ€™t touch food directly, any EPA-registered disinfectant is fine. If a product is EPA-registered, that registration number will likely appear on the bottle somewhere (next to the letters â€œEPAâ€). Make note of the contact time listed on the bleach label. To properly disinfect something, a bleach cleaner needs to sit on the surface youâ€™re working with for a set amount of time; it might be as short as one minute, but, in my experience, five minutes is the most common guidance on product labels. Once again, the product label will be your guide here; read it and then do what it says. While youâ€™re there, also pay attention to any information about how much product to use (a lot of wipes will say something like â€œuse enough wipes so the surface remains visibly wet for four minutesâ€) and note whether youâ€™re supposed to rinse the surface with water and then dry it after youâ€™ve disinfected. Put on grungy clothes you donâ€™t care about while youâ€™re cleaning with bleach. Bleach products can, unsurprisingly, remove the color from your clothes. Open a window and/or turn on a fan when using any chemical cleaners. Chemical fumes are no joke. They can leave you with a sore throat or headache, something you definitely donâ€™t need right now (or... ever). So open windows when youâ€™re cleaning (if you get cold, put on an old hoodie) and leave the room or area for the five-ish minutes that the bleach is sitting on the surface, doing its thing. Itâ€™s also a good idea to blast fans (including the one above many stoves, which is easy to forget about). If the chemical smell is really strong, avoid using air fresheners or lighting candles in an attempt to cover the smell; scented products can emit irritants that compound the problem. Instead, just keep the fresh air flowing, and try to keep your distance from the source. Wear gloves and take other available precautions to save your skin when using disinfectants. Ideally, youâ€™d put on a fresh pair of disposable gloves (like nitrile gloves ) every time you do a bleach choreâ€”and thatâ€™s true even if youâ€™re cleaning inside a home where youâ€™ve been hunkered for several weeks, and have strong reason to believe is COVID-19-free. The gloves are there to protect your skin, first and foremost. If you only have non-disposable gloves, wash your gloved hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds between chores to avoid cross-contamination, and fully disinfect them after youâ€™re done. If you happen to have goggles, put those on, too. Bleach (and ammonia) can irritate and damage your eyes and cause vision loss. If you donâ€™t have any gloves, be extra conscious of how bleach and other disinfecting products can damage your skin, and make a point to use a light touch when handling bleach solutionâ€“soaked rags, paper towels, etc. And, of course, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after youâ€™re done. On that noteâ€¦ do not apply any bleach or other disinfecting products directly to your skin. Please. Instead of trying to bleach everything in sight, prioritize cleaning your handsâ€”and even surfacesâ€”with soap and water. Jane Greatorex, a virologist at Cambridge University, told National Geographic that using bleach â€œis like using a bludgeon to swat a fly.â€ According to the experts interviewed, a milder soap, like dish soap, plus water is very effective on surfaces, so you might want to go that route for some of your chores. All of the experts emphasized the role of frequent, proper hand washing in preventing the spread of the virus, and stressed that soap is really effective against SARS-CoV-2. Disinfect your cleaning tools. According to Mendelson, reusable cleaning implements (like dishcloths or rags) should be cleaned after a single useâ€”so, laundered in hot water with detergent and chlorine bleach. If you donâ€™t have a washing machine, she says to wash them by hand in hot, soapy water; rinse them; and then soak them in a fresh bleach solution for five minutes. Then rinse and air dry. Know that bleach can actually go bad. If you happened upon a dusty jug of Clorox under your sink last week and thought, Score!!! be sure to look for its expiration date, and donâ€™t use any bleach that is past its dateâ€”it might not actually be effective.

Even more encouraging is the fact that she is aware of how much money people are making at the expense of others and will repeat these fines every 24 hours to repeat offenders. FHN Florida Radio reportsA glaring price gouging example includes an online ad, now removed, selling four cans of Lysol disinfectant spray for a whopping $10,100. Thinking of inflating prices to sell protective gowns, gloves, hand sanitizer or cleaning supplies during Floridaâ€™s COVID-19 state of emergency? Think again, says Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody. Unless you want to be investigated and potentially pay civil fines of $1,000 per violation, up to a total of $25,000 for multiple violations committed in a single 24-hour period. Thatâ€™s the message Moody has been touting since March, when her office launched a price gouging hotline and a Rapid Response Team to confirm reports of unlawful price increases. A glaring example includes an online ad selling four cans of Lysol disinfectant spray for a whopping $10,100. â€œUnbelievable,â€ Moody stated on Twitter March 25. â€œMy Rapid Response Team acted quickly, and this post has been removed.â€ Another online ad, now removed, was charging $187 for eight cans of Lysol, according to the Attorney Generalâ€™s Twitter account. There have been ads selling 105 Clorox wipes for $68.99, or an offer to buy a â€œ30-day certified c-virus protection kitâ€ for $199. Since March 9, when Gov. Ron DeSantis activated the stateâ€™s COVID-19 emergency declaration activating Floridaâ€™s price gouging laws, Moodyâ€™s office has issued dozens of subpoenas, deactivated more than 100 online posts and secured thousands in direct refunds for consumers. â€œOur first goal is to deter price gouging in real time,â€ Moody said in a prepared statement, â€œso consumers can afford the essential commodities they need to stay healthy as we fight the COVID-19 pandemic together.â€ If the price of an essential commodity represents a â€œgross disparityâ€ from the average price charged 30 days before the stateâ€™s declared state of emergency, or grossly exceeds the average market price for an area, then the price may be unlawful, according to Moody. Her office on Monday was unable to provide specific price gouging complaints from the Treasure Coast but examples are being investigated all over the state. Officials are looking at a Florida man who created a GoFundMe page supposedly to raise $2,000 to buy masks for first responders. â€œAt the exact same time, he was selling masks on his website for about $12 a piece,â€ Moody stated. â€œWe had the post removed and are investigating.â€ Another Florida business bought cleaning supplies, toilet paper and other items at a discount store and then tried to resell them at double the price. â€œAfter my Rapid Response Team contacted the business,â€ Moody noted on Twitter, â€œthey decided to donate the items to a local charity.â€ Essential commodities covered by Floridaâ€™s price gouging law under the COVID-19 state of emergency include: Protective face masks Sanitizing and disinfecting supplies, such as hand sanitizer, gel wipes, products for surface cleaning and commercial cleaning supplies All personal protective equipment including gowns, booties and gloves Report price gouging complaints by calling 866-966-7226, visiting MyFloridaLegal.com or get the NO SCAM smartphone app. Since activating the Price Gouging Hotline, Moodyâ€™s Office has: Received 1,210 consumer contacts about the price of essential commodities Made 1,900 referrals and contacts to merchants about allegations of price gouging, refunds and scams Secured $79,000 in refunds related to travel, leisure and product purchases Issued 56 subpoenas to further price gouging investigations Worked with online platforms to deactivate more than 100 posts offering items for outrageous prices If you suspect youâ€™re being scammed and want to report a complaint, Moody suggests taking pictures of advertised prices, price tags or receipts and keep copies of any estimates or bills. Compare products, noting similarities and differences, by recording the productâ€™s name, brand, size or quantity, manufacturer, model number and price. Source:

Human behavior is strange. Antibacterial wipes such as Lysol and Clorox etc, bleach and antibacterial soaps apparently kill 99% of germs and viruses, and they're sold out everyday. All this frenzied cleaning, yet, the Corona Virus is evidently in the 1% that can't be killed.
I am sick of all the bad info. They said the virus only survives for 72 hours. Now I'm reading 17 DAYS! I have exposed myself numerous times to household items because I thought I was good if I didn't touch it for 3 days. Instead of a stimulus they should be giving out cleaning products. I can't afford to keep 100 percent clean and I can't even find basic stuff like lysol or hand sanitizer. Our priorities are messed up.
I donâ€™t understand as a ocd clean freak I usually always have Lysol in stock, why are we still unable to get proper disinfectant products or toilet paper or isopropyl 91% alcohol. They are just as important as face masks. #COVID19 #toiletpaper #lysol #panicbuying

I hope all the ones unfollowing "Food Babe" because of this post because you disagree with her divorce your husbands and wives, disown your children, malice your friends and switch political parties because they say something or stand up for something you disagree with. Temper tantrums won't solve anything. We need to understand that disagreements are inevitable in all aspects of life or there wouldn't be a balance and the pendulum would go crashing down. Why are we fighting over the #'s?h So we can prove this is not as serious or is as serious as "they" want us to believe? The fact is people are dying early deaths regardless if it's from Corona or not. If it's from heart attacks, strokes, HBP, diabetes or whatever food born disease or illness, it's still unnecessary early death..Most people who have those diseases got them from the crap they are eating some knowingly and some unknowingly. Food Babe started a powerful campaign to help with the spread of the FOOD VIRUS going around that helped killed some of these people dying now because their bodies can't handle the Corona. Look how many people running out now to buy lysol, toxic hand sanitizers and cleaning products and all of a sudden worried about their health because of this virus but weren't concerned about the numerous deaths occurring because of the leeching food industry. There is usually a root cause to everything and thanks to Food Babe she is trying to get to end the root cause of what's causing most of the diseases that's been going around before this coronavirus. The #'s are unimportant at this moment the root cause is. Somebody who died of a heart attack yesterday and was reported to have died from corona probably ate too many Subway sandwiches with azodiccarbonomide in it or ate too much of some food preservative that she is fighting against them putting in our food. Her purpose far outweighs all this disagreeing nonsense about some #'s.

JudiciousGiraffe said: Posted 1 hr ago A guy who routinely vacationed in China for 3+ months at a time (Australian dude!) said he could smell the wet markets long before he arrived (he did not partake in any food prepped or sold there). He said the streets are covered in feces, blood, animals pieces, etc. No one wears any kind of gloves or anything. Knives and prep tools are rinsed in a bucket of water and wiped on dirty cloth. Said families/kids are playing while parents are purchasing. Kids feet, hands, toys all on the ground with no thought or issue taken by anyone to realize theyâ€™re playing in feces and blood. It was a lot. He said where he went in China he loved so much. Said the people were always amazing, as was the food, and how each town/city brought itâ€™s own rich culture to the table. His bottom line was regulation. Certain places need regulation and that the majority of people in China (and subsequently world) agree. He said once this is over he will resume his yearly treks there as heâ€™s made so many friends whoâ€™ve become family over the years. I wish I could find the article. It was sad, fascinating, and revolting all at the same time. There was a documentary put out about ten years ago- Babies. I think itâ€™s on netflix still. It is fascinating. They follow 4 babies around the world for their first year. I saw scenes similar to what you describe here. Babies playing right next to entrails being washed etc. you can see it in this trailer There is growing evidence that we need exposure to microbes or the immune system will over react(see studies on gut health and dirt microbes, also animals in the home and the impact on immune systems). It changed my mindset on how â€œcleanâ€ I needed to keep my house. We stay â€œcleanâ€ but not necessarily â€œdisinfectedâ€. I wash our dishes with soap, but kid baths usually donâ€™t have soap unless they need it. The toilet gets cleaned with bleach or lysol, but the tub only gets a clorox once very few months or as needed(floating dookie), the rest of the time itâ€™s just soap and water. I have probably gone through more general cleaning supplies in the last month than I have in the last 5 years. I am not saying kids should be allowed in blood and feces, but more that in that area and culture they probably have and need gut microbes that fight off salmonella or botulism etc better. They are born with them from mom, so a baby there vs a baby born here will fare better in that environment.

Keep your mask on while wiping down your groceries. My sister was telling me this morning her son who is a nurse to do that. I wasn't doing that I wasn't even thinking of doing that, but it does make sense. Also keep your gloves on while wiping down the items. She told me she has a can of Lysol that she had bought last year and on the can it says it kills the coronavirus. This made me wonder how long someone knew about this virus. Now you can't find a can of it to see if it's still on it.

MaiHÃ­r PÃ©nz It just got harder to get, refinance a mortgage: Who will face more difficulty â€“ USA TODAY It just got harder to get, refinance a mortgage: Who will face more difficulty â€“ USA TODAY Susan Tompor Detroit Free Press Published 3:24 PM EDT Apr 9, 2020 Record spikes in jobless claims are creating major roadblocks for consumers who thought that theyâ€™d like to save money by snagging a lower mortgage rate. Maybe, you thought you might even refinance the mortgage to get your hands on some cash now by taking out some equity thatâ€™s built up as your homeâ€™s value has grown? Maybe youâ€™re looking at your house as a piggy bank after losing a job during the coronavirus pandemic? Itâ€™s a thought, but itâ€™s a strategy that likely wonâ€™t work.â€œFor people who are unemployed, itâ€™s going to be more difficult to qualify for a mortgage at this time,â€ said Bill Banfield, executive vice president of capital markets for Detroit-based Quicken Loans. â€œThe ability to repay debt is based on the personâ€™s income.â€Jobless claims surging: Another 6.6M Americans file for unemployment benefits as layoffs show no letup Looking for Lysol spray or Clorox wipes?: COVID-19 wiped out disinfectants Itâ€™s not to say that people who arenâ€™t working canâ€™t refinance their mortgages, he said. Retirees, for example, may be able to refinance a mortgage if they can point to a steady pension or annuities that can be used to repay the debt. Yet things are getting tougher for many people who want to refinance a mortgage than they were back in February and early March. Weâ€™ve seen dramatic, unexpected job losses associated with shutting down much of the U.S. economy to combat the coronavirus. During the week ending March 27, a record 6.6 million Americans applied for jobless benefits. â€œUnemployment will certainly be an issue for folks trying to refinance,â€ said Keith Gumbinger, a mortgage expert and vice president at HSH.com, a mortgage information website. While many people will receive jobless benefits, Gumbinger said getting an unemployment check typically isnâ€™t viewed as a reasonable stream of income, which is necessary to qualify for a mortgage. Federally-backed mortgages, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, do allow for the use of unemployment benefits in the case of steady but seasonal employment. A seasonal worker, for example, can document that they received jobless payments consistently for at least two years and be considered for a mortgage. â€œUnemployment compensation cannot be used to qualify the borrower unless it is clearly associated with seasonal employment that is reported on the borrowerâ€™s signed federal income tax returns,â€ according to regulations. And the lender must verify that the seasonal income is likely to continue. No doubt, ultra-low mortgage rates make refinancing a mortgage quite tempting. â€œCertainly, interest in refinancing has again kicked higher,â€ Gumbinger said. Gumbinger noted that the pattern of refinancing activity in the last four weeks was up 78.6% for the week ending March 6, down 10.4% for the week ending March 13, down 33.8% for the week ending March 20 and now up 25.5% for refinance applications for the week ending March 27, based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average conforming 30-year mortgage rate last week was 3.33% â€” down only slightly from a 3.6% range in January. A year ago, during late March, the average was 4.12%. â€œRates are still very low for the conforming, government-backed loans and it continues to be a refinancing bonanza,â€ said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. But he warned that lenders are experiencing a backlog of refinancing applications. Borrower demand has been exceeding the lenderâ€™s capacity to handle refinancing mortgages in many cases, McBride said. Bankrate.comâ€™s most recent research indicates that the average 30-year fixed rate is 3.74% as of the week of April 1. The average 30-year rate on a jumbo mortgage is 3.92%. Jumbo loans, which often require larger down payments, apply to mortgages that exceed $510,400. While the coronavirus pandemic is stressful and shocking to everyone, we all arenâ€™t facing the same challenges and issues. So you have to figure out what works for you. â€œIf you have lost your job or expect to, then refinancing probably wonâ€™t be possible,â€ said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moodyâ€™s. If you have lost a job, talking to your lender or mortgage servicer about coronavirus mortgage relief options, such as a way to delay making payments for 90 days, could make more sense. â€œAsking for forbearance, which you should get if you have a FHA, Fannie or Freddie loan, should be your first priority. If your job isnâ€™t threatened, and your existing mortgage has anything more than a 4% rate, you should be refinancing,â€ Zandi said. ContactSusan Tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.

Monmouth County Freeholder Director Tom Arnone and Freeholder Deputy Director Sue Kiley have announced the new positive cases of COVID-19 in Monmouth County bringing the total to 3,512 overall as of Friday morning. Howell has the most cases in Monmouth County with 316, Middletown has 284 and Manalapan has 274 cases. Here are the cases by town in Monmouth County according to the Freeholders and MCHD: -advertisement- Here is some other news and notes regarding the Covid-19 pandemic in Monmouth County: Unsplash The best thing you can is to stay home! More than anything else, this will help reduce strain and impact on health care workers and the health care system by keeping more people safe and healthy. Other things you can do to directly support medical teams is to donate any personal protective equipment (PPE) you may have, call elected officials to support a federal response to ensure PPE is available to health-care workers, donate money, and possibly help by making face masks to help in certain instances. There are detailed support instructions for more ways to help health care workers offered by the American Medical Association. Cat Box // Shutterstock The flu and COVID-19 symptoms are a bit similar, so itâ€™s important to pay attention right now if you get sick. Both can include fever, muscle ache, and fatigue, but COVID-19 often also includes a dry cough and shortness of breath. If you have any questions about your symptoms, call the Centers for Disease Control Self-Check and call your doctor. If you are experiencing respiratory distress, seek medical help immediately. Unsplash Since it is possible for the COVID-19 virus to live on surfaces for hours to days, cleaning is key. Cleaning products that kill this virus include soap and water, bleach, surgical spirits (basically high-strength ethanol), and hand sanitizers with ethanol higher than 70%. Cleaning and disinfecting your kitchen and other high-use areas will help kill any living virus in your home. Airing out inside air also helps, since the virus is airborne. Plus, if someone is in your home who has COVID-19 (whether they know it or not), adopting cleaning procedures will help protect other residents in your home. Unsplash For basic treatment of COVID-19 symptoms the Mayo Clinic recommends pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, cough suppressants and medications, plenty of fluids, and lots of rest. At the time of this writing there is not an antiviral medication recommended. Unsplash Yes, smokers are at significantly greater risk of serious complications from COVID-19 than non-smokers. Smokersâ€™ lungs are already compromised, and the additional impact of the respiratory complications from novel coronavirus is that much harder on the lungs. The New England Journal of Medicine published a paper Feb. 28, 2020, that showed smokers, or those who smoked regularly in the past, have a 10% greater chance of serious complications from COVID-19 than non-smokers. Unsplash It is a good idea to up your laundry game during the pandemic. The virus is able to survive on surfaces, including cloth, for varying periods of time. Basic laundry instructions from health-care experts are: Wash your clothes in hot water above 80 degrees; use a detergent with a bleach compound; and wash clothes separately from anyone at home who is sick. If you need to use a laundromat, disinfect surfaces with wipes as you would while grocery shopping. When you get home, change out of the clothes you were wearing, leave your shoes at the door, and hop in the shower. Unsplash During this time, take-out or delivery of food from local eateries may be a balm to you and to your local businesses. Is it safe? With some precautions, yes. Health experts say that as long as you wash your hands well after removing the outer packaging, you will remove any points of contact for the virus to infect you. Do not go out if youâ€™re sick, while you are out it's safest to assume everyone is potentially contagiousâ€”this is essential for protecting yourself, but also for protecting those who deliver and serve food. Keep â€œno contactâ€ protocols in place as much as possible. Unsplash First, reduce your number of outings as much as possible: Order groceries to be delivered or pick them up curbside. If you do need to physically enter a store, there are a few key ways to protect yourself and others while shopping. Always wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds before, and especially after, you go out. Stay at least six feet away from other people while you are out. Wipe down all surfaces you will touch, like the grocery cart or shopping basket handle, with a disinfecting wipe before putting your hand on it. Some experts also advise wiping down all containers when you get home before putting them away since the virus can live on plastics and metals for days. You can also do this if you order groceries to be delivered. If it's cool enough outside, leaving groceries for 24 hours on your front porch or in your garage is another option. Unsplash Now that we know a large portion of people can spread the virus without realizing they are infected â€”and that COVID-19 can spread through talking and breathing â€”the CDC has issued a recommendation that people wear face masks in public settings. Guidelines on the CDC website outline the best fabric to use for masks (cotton) and how to make your own, homemade masks. N-95 masks are needed by health-care workers for their personal protective equipment, and should remain reserved for health care workers only. Unsplash COVID-19 lives for various lengths of time on familiar surfaces and you may be at risk of being exposed if you do not take precautions. Knowing how long the virus lives on different surfaces can help people be proactive about how they handle things like boxes, mail, and groceries. For example, COVID-19 can survive for up to nine days on plastic and steel, while it may live for up to one day in the air or on cardboard. Unsplash The best guidance is to stay home and stay put. Do not travel to other places, or second homes in the country. Others who travel like this are risking the possibility of spreading the virus. The science of COVID-19 is clear: People who travel increase the risk to others by inadvertently spreading this highly contagious and dangerous virus. Unsplash Delivery drivers for places like the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and Amazon have quickly found themselves on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their deliveries are even more important now that many Americans depend on deliveries for essential food and other items. Unfortunately, many drivers are physically unprotected and don't have health insurance. Companies are working to solve a situation where drivers face a high risk of exposure by doing their normal jobs. You can take precautions at home by cleaning out the inside of your mailbox with a disinfectant wipe and respecting a delivery person's space by letting them set packages down for you without you taking them by hand. If you want to leave a care package for delivery workers, follow all protocols for safety as you assemble it. To protect yourself, you can set aside your mail for 24 hours (the length of time COVID-19 can survive on paper and cardboard) and wash your hands thoroughly after opening mail and discarding envelopes. Unsplash Many Americans have all but stopped driving, however some still need to get gas for essential trips or essential work outside the home. Protect yourself and others when you pump by wiping every surface you touch with disinfecting wipes, before and after pumping. If you can, use EPA-registered household disinfectants, such as Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Lysol brand disinfectants. The CDC is not recommending gloves unless you are sick, in which case, please stay home. And remember, wash hands thoroughly before and after gassing up and any errands, donâ€™t touch your face, and keep those trips to a minimum. Unsplash A whole host of healthy habits will give you and your body a great immune boost. Drinking plenty of water, getting fresh air and exercise, building in socially distant time with friends, and adding garlic, mushrooms, and vitamin C to your diet are all great ways to naturally build up your immune system. Check out this great list of tips from Stacker on boosting your immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unsplash So far there is little to no data on pets being infected with COVID-19 and the Centers for Disease Control says this is rare. However, because we know the virus is so contagious to humans and may live for hours or days on some surfaces, it makes sense to err on the side of caution with your pet. Until we know more, it makes sense to hold off on letting others pet your dog and certainly to take all precautions like careful hand-washing if your dog does interact with another person. However, if you are sick with COVID-19 you mustn't take or let your pet out and risk exposing others through accidental contact with your pet. Unsplash One of the reasons COVID-19 is so dangerous is it spreads very effectively to others from those who donâ€™t realize theyâ€™re infected. These people are â€œ asymptomatic â€ or have such a mild response to the disease that they donâ€™t realize they might have it. Up to half of all infections are in mild or asymptomatic people who spread the virus with no awareness they are doing so, according to research reported on March 20, 2020, in the journal Nature. This happens through â€œviral shedding;â€ when the virus is fully active in peopleâ€™s nose, throats, and lungsâ€”and fully contagiousâ€”even in mild or asymptomatic cases. As many as 25% of those infected may not show symptoms, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control on March 30, 2020. Of note: On April 2, 2020, a panel of experts advised the White House that COVID-19 can spread through talking and breathing, not just through sneezes and coughs. Unsplash Life will be different after a global pandemic. Almost everyone on Earth has already been affected one way or another, and some of these impacts will be lasting. We donâ€™t know yet how quickly we will develop a vaccine or effective drugs, but people are working around the clock to help everyone adapt to this immediate â€œnew normal.â€ As the pandemic surges in the immediate future and countries around the world work to â€œ flatten the curve,â€ one thing to keep in mind is that pandemics have impacted human civilization before and people have responded in various creative ways depending on the time, era, and the traits of the disease itself. The question now is, how will we respond? You may also like: 25 virology terms to help you understand outbreaks, from the common cold to COVID-19 Unsplash It appears as though it is possible to be infected with the virus more than once, although diagnostic testing is not thorough enough to be conclusive. Some people in Wuhan, China, have tested positive more than once. There are also many people who have likely had the disease and donâ€™t know for sure, because they have not been able to be tested. Unsplash The Centers for Disease Control has specific instructions for what to do while you are sick, that include isolating and practicing protective hygiene. Always call your doctor if you have questions. Seek immediate medical attention if you have,â€œtrouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or have bluish lips or face. This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.â€ Unsplash The White House in early April 2020 issued specific social distancing guidance urging older Americans and those with underlying health conditions to stay home and to avoid other people. The best way to support your older parents is to help make sure they are prepared to shelter in place, follow all protocols for self-protection if food or other items are delivered, and hold off on visits during the immediacy of the pandemic. Adults over 65, or with certain conditions like diabetes or impaired heart or lung function, are at almost double the risk for serious complications from COVID-19. Unsplash Itâ€™s basic chemistry! Soap is special; because of its chemical structure it powerfully breaks molecules apart. Washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds essentially destroys and removes any virus or bacteria that may be on your hands. In fact, according to Popular Science, Mathew Freeman, a professor of epidemiology and global health at Emory University, says that, â€œHandwashing with soap for 20 seconds is one of the single most important practices to protect yourself, your family, and your community.â€ You may also like: COVID-19 is the latest example of zoonosisâ€”here are 30 other diseases animals transmit to humans Uhsplash There is no clear evidence that wearing gloves will protect people who leave their homes to shop for basic, essential items. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend wearing gloves if you are caring for someone at home who has COVID-19. But some researchers are concerned that wearing gloves as a measure to protect yourself can actually backfire, as the gloves may offer a false sense of security. They urge people to always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after any essential trip out. Unsplash Most likely, yes. The doubts about ibuprofen surfaced in part as a result of a letter published on March 12, 2020, in the journal The Lancet. The story serves as a cautionary tale in a pandemic, when people may seize on information that is not accurate and spread it. The letter in question hypothesized that some medications, including ibuprofen, might possibly make it easier for the novel coronavirus to infect cells. There was no study or evidence to support this claim besides an idea about how the virus might possibly interact with the medication in the body. It is fine to choose acetaminophen to feel better if you are concerned. According to an NPR story on March 18, 2020, Dr. Angela Rogers, â€œa pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, says that Tylenol (acetaminophen) is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection.â€ If you have any questions about whether to take ibuprofen for COVID-19 symptoms, call your doctor. Africa Studio // Shutterstock Although COVID-19 is generally most risky for older adults and those with certain health conditions, the Centers for Disease Control research released on March 18, 2020, show that a significant number of younger people also get seriously ill. As many as one-fifth of infected 20- to 44-year-olds require hospitalization, with 2% to 4% of those needing intensive care. Death in this age group is less common than in older age groups (less than 1% reported). Maridav // Shutterstock Emerging data from numerous countries indicates that men have a greater risk of infection, serious illness, and death related to COVID-19 than women, with death rates nearly double that of women (although this depends on the country and other factors). At first, researchers thought this might be related to behavior differences, such as hand-washing choices, seeking medical treatment, or smoking. However, the pattern is now so pronounced across the world that researchers suspect there is a fundamental biological mechanism at work that we will only know with more research.

No I would not pay $2 $3 or any amount for a in home concert online giving this coronavirus pandemic we are going through and we are catching a bad break with stores charging $20 for a can of Lysol.
None of these solutions will have any affect on the coronavirus. The real question is when you go out what are you doing that you think the virus is transferring to your seats? If itÂ’s a concern I would spray your clothes with Lysol and use a hand sanitizer on you skin before getting in. But remember you must let the Lysol sit on your clothes for 10 minutes to be effective.

Then put away food. Â All veggies and fruit are put into a bowl of water and soap and then Washed and rinsed well. Â There are 3-4 days in a row when none of us leave the house and no deliveries are brought into the house. Â So no exposure.Â If you havenâ€™t touch your tools there is no need to sanitize them.Â You immediately wash you hands when you come in from the outside. Routinely washing your hands throughout the day should now be the norm.Â Dishes. I do not wash any dish, pot, silverware by hand. Everything goes in the dishwasher now. Wash your hands before unloading the dishes.Â Â You luggage should not of come into the house without wiping it off first. If you wanted to be cautious, the clothes should of been washed , taken from the luggage direct to the washer. And the toiletries wiped down before put away.

Posing with a Swiffer and its cleaning pads, as well as a bottle of Lysol, box of rubber gloves and a scrub brush on Wednesday, Jessica cheekily captioned her makeup-free photo, "Housewife of the Year looks a little different these days." It also should be noted that there's a vacuum propped up behind her, showing off that a housewife's work is never done, especially during a pandemic where every surface must be sanitized. On top of throwing in additional cleaning supplies, the Open Book author traded in the pink pumps and flirty undergarments for calico-colored slippers and a ripple effect onesie, along with a matching blue and white bandana. Things have radically changed for Jessica since her memorable 2003 magazine cover. Back then, she was starring alongside ex-husband Nick Lachey in their reality TV show Newlyweds and her song "With You" was atop the US Mainstream Top 40 list. Nowadays, she's a New York Times bestselling author with her autobiography Open Book and is focused on her clothing line -- when she's not doting on her three children eight-year-old Maxwell, seven-year-old Ace and one-year-old Birdie Mae. On top of that, she's been using her free time to comfort fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging everyone last Wednesday to pray with her "for the leaders around the world including our president, governors, mayors, politicians, scientists, doctors, and all healthcare workers" and told fans to "stay strong."

Public spaces (including streets, markets, shopping precincts, community centres, parks, playgrounds, and neighbourhood spaces in residential areas) play a vital role in the social life of communities. Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) is an acute respiratory disease caused by a novel Corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted in most instances through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cases and also through contaminated surfaces/objects. Though the virus survives on environmental surfaces for varied period of time, it gets easily inactivated by chemical disinfectants. Ever since COVID-19 outbreak was declared as global pandemic, Indian Cities have been making significant efforts in sanitizing the cities, especially the public spaces which are considered risk prone areas for local spread of virus. Since the nation-wide lockdown was announced on 25 March 2020, Cities have been adopting numerous approaches to disinfect the public spaces including the bus/railway stations, streets, markets, hospital premises, banks, etc. City Governments have collaborated with Fire Departments and used fire-tenders, water wash pumps, etc., to sanitize all the streets in the city by spraying disinfectants. To facilitate availability of essential supplies such as fresh vegetables the agricultural markets were made operational in cities and measures have been taken by City Governments to keep these places safe. Hand-washing facilities are being provided at vegetable markets and other public places. Cities are taking up innovative approaches for disinfection of public places using sodium hypochlorite, for example Tiruppur has recently implemented a disinfection tunnel, which is now replicated in numerous cities at their agricultural/ vegetable markets. Modeled on this, various establishments entrusted with provision of essential services are deploying the disinfection chambers. For efficient geographical coverage in disinfection of public streets, Cities of Rajkot and Surat have adopted high-clearance boom sprayers. Smart Cities such as Chennai, Bengaluru, Raipur and Guwahati have prepared themselves to use technology solutions such as Drones to disinfect the public spaces in the situation where human access gets difficult. Some of the key measures adopted by Smart Cities include: City Initiative Guwahati Sanitation activities are carried out across the city. Anti-bacterial is being sprayed in all corners of the city to keep it safe from any kind of infection. 1,200 workers assigned duty, door-to-door garbage collection will be carried in the morning hours, sanitation workers will be deployed across the city after sundown to spray disinfectants Muzaffarpur Disinfectant spray - Sanitization of whole city is under way using Fogging, anti-larva spray and disinfectant spray. Patna City Administration (Patna Municipal Corporation) has ensured disinfection of all public places in the city using Jetting Machines since 24 March 2020. Sanitization of all the public utility buildings such as banks, hospitals, etc. has been undertaken. Bihar State Road Transport Corporation buses were sanitized by Patna Municipal Corporation. This step has been taken as a precautionary measure against corona virus outbreak. Dharamshala Fire tenders used for spraying sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution for comprehensive disinfection of public places.

This tunnel was set up by the District Administration in collaboration with Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry. The â€˜disinfection tunnelâ€™ is part of efforts by the Tiruppur District administration to prevent further spread of corona virus. People who enter the market are asked to wash their hands and walk through the â€˜disinfection tunnelâ€™ for three to four seconds during which sprayers overhead sprinkle protective substance on them. Once they come out of the â€˜disinfection tunnelâ€™, the visitors are allowed into the market. Rajkot Rajkot uses high-clearance boom sprayers for disinfection of public streets and public places. Four High Clearance Boom Sprayers (used in Agricultural Fields) are being used by Rajkot Municipal Corporation to spray disinfectants on the roads and streets of Rajkot. We will soon be procuring 14 more such machines. Thus covering all 18 wards of the City. Courtesy: pib.gov.in

Rai posted... Amazon ruining my life again. I pre-ordered this game five years ago. Count that... Not five months... Five years! You can't tell me there are people ahead of me. Oh and did I mention it has priority shipping. Yeah... Says 14th or 15th arrival. They have done this to me for years! Yes I know it can be attributed to Corona, but it was marked as delayed in like january., And this has happened every time. Sigh... If I didn't get it for so cheap due to really old e3 preorder with cheap price and added 30% off bonus, I would have just cancelled and grabbed digital. Enjoy your epic game guys... Man, I DO feel bad for the guys that don't have it yet. Ughh, I know it's easy to say this because I just got my game but man....be patient - it's coming! And boy, it's a nice box. It'll be worth it, trust me. It's a nice collector's item for sure. I know I'd be pissed too if it hadn't come in by Friday and I'd hate to wait through the entire weekend. Post up here when it arrives. :) TboiGreezy posted... Not really it comes down to where you live and luck of the draw I'm in Canada like TC and the earliest this could have shipped to me was the 15th Where in Canada? I'm in London. Seriously, I'm like absolutely shocked this came in today. Due to the fact I wasn't even expecting it I almost didn't answer the buzzer. I was like...who the hell is that? Wasn't expecting anyone...and BOOM. A guy with a yellow package...I knew right away....:) I wiped the damn plastic with lysol just to be safe. I'm not even supposed to have people in the building that don't live here.... PrettyBoyMarth posted... Did you order in-store or online and when did you preorder? I order online but originally ordered in store with no payment. I was lucky....was gonna order from BB but they were out of stock, Checked EB and was like ok....I gotta do it. It was on March 22nd. A couple days later, the EB was out of stock too. Way lucky! Chronux posted... once again digital gets screwed over, pretty much almost all ( except those who ordered amazon rofl ) have the game already, except digital. Way to go square, nice world release you f***s I do hear ya...this was NOT the way to go about it. Corona or not....it's INEXCUSABLE for people to have received the game 3 weeks in advance. That's just unheard of. I for one won't even be popping it in until tomorrow anyway...I'm hoping for a day one patch. Apparently there's some texture issues which I hope get resolved. I don't want to play the game and notice these weird low rez textures that they talked about over there at digital foundry. If no patch, that's gonna be unfortunate considering the demo looked so perfect. They said the slum areas ae loaded with blurry textures.....I'm nervous! Coming out of RE2, God of War and Uncharted 4....how could Square do this to this game? I'm crossing my fingers.... Takun1_2 posted... Then there's me who hasn't heard anything about my order.. Filled out the form and everything.. Dude...are you in Ontario? Anyway, I know it's tough but hold on....it's coming. The release for this game is kinda bs due to the virus but what can ya do? I can't really blame Square, either....they're just doing their best to not disappoint as many people as possible. Let's just be happy that with all of this we were able to prevent spoilers from happening.....I didn't even check out that final release trailer. I feel proud of myself for that, for sure! Everyone here in Canada....let us know when ya get your copies. I'm just wondering why some are not getting it yet. That f***in sucks.

Several weeks ago I saw on the news that in order for a cleaner to be effective against COVID19, that it should say on the label that it kills the human coronavirus. So far I have seen that only on Clorox, Lysol and Microban labels. Many people are still buying just anything. Is what I heard true and shouldnâ€™t that information be spread more? Also, a lot of businesses are using cleaning sprays that donâ€™t refer to the human Coronavirus on the label. Also, when they spray something down, they wipe it off right away. Are they using ineffective cleaners and not properly disinfecting to protect us? Thanks!

New Jersey Democrat Lawmaker Fantasizes About Withholding Disinfectants From Kentuckians Amid COVID-19 Crisis to Stick it to McConnell [link to www.thegatewaypundit.com (secure)] "New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski on Thursday fantasized about withholding disinfectants from Kentuckians in order to strong arm Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Coronavirus bill. Malinowski is your typical Democrat thug. The Coronavirus pandemic is sweeping across the US and the CDC is instructing Americans to be extra vigilant by cleaning and disinfecting their hands and homes in order to reduce the risk of getting infected by COVID-19, but Democrat Malinowski is fantasizing about sticking it to Kentuckians. The National Republican Congressional Committee blasted Democrat Malinowski. â€œWhile Americans are putting their political differences aside to work together, @Malinowski admitted heâ€™s fantasized about withholding Coronavirus-killing disinfectants from Kentuckians to stick it to Mitch McConnell,â€ the NRCC said. â€œFun fact about Somerset County, uh, we make 100% of the national supply of Lysol disinfectant,â€ Malinowski said on a video conference call. â€œI thought about using that with, like, Mitch McConnell â€” like hey, you know, weâ€™re gonna hold up the Lysol to Kentucky until you pass ourâ€¦bill,â€ Malinowski said. Many people on the conference call gave a â€˜thumbs upâ€™ in support of Malinowskiâ€™s disgusting fantasy."

There is no win no matter what the government does. Do nothing and everyone gets sick and people die.Then everyone complains they didn't do enough. Shut everything down and prevent it from getting out of hand and everyone claims they were overreacting and the problem was exaggerated. Projections are pretty much guesses based on what is known from the most similar situations that have already occurred, they are by no means 100% accurate. [URL unfurl="true"]https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/trumps-top-health-officials-predict-diminished-coronavirus-death-toll-171456[/URL] In this article (one of the few I can find on new projections) specifically states that previous projections assumed that only half of Americans would follow social distancing, whereas many more ended up doing so. so yeah, that will drop the projected death toll quite a lot. TBH, people only took measures because they are scared. When people are complacent that's when shit goes south.

So the "dont take it crowd"....you are wrong. GET THE SHOT IT WORKS. intial symptoms were of course flu like, bad diarrhea for a week or so dehydration...If you got tested get on them or inform CDC if it takes more than a week. This mans family have been waiting 3 so far All he does is go to work and back, hardly any interaction with people (works on police cars) doesnt know where he picked it up WEAR A MASK and wash everything.

Utah basketball player Niyah Becker couldn't make it home to Winnipeg, Canada, so she moved into off-campus housing with a couple of teammates. David Dennis/Icon Sportswire Syracuse track and field athlete Iliass Aouani started hearing the stories from back home in Milan, Italy, about the coronavirus months ago. Of course, he worried about his family's safety as his hometown became the epicenter for spread. But even then, in mid-February, he never anticipated what would happen here in the United States. "One day you are training normally, the next, it seemed like a movie, no one could believe this would be happening," Aouani said. The COVID-19 pandemic wiped out the remaining college sports seasons, with spring sports like outdoor track and field taking the largest hit. As if the sudden end was not enough of a shock, the measures universities started to implement to try to keep their students safe delivered a far different set of challenges for international student-athletes. Should they stay in the United States or go back to their home countries? What if they had no choice in the matter? According to the NCAA, there are more than 20,000 international student-athletes competing at NCAA schools. There are no quantifiable figures on how many stayed in the U.S. and how many left. But based on interviews with athletes and coaches across a wide range of sports, decisions about what to do varied based on individual circumstances and campus recommendations. Sticking aroundAouani knew there was no way he could go back to Italy, considering the situation there. His hometown was on complete lockdown -- nobody is allowed to go outside, even for a run or stroll. His family told him they believe people in their neighborhood died, but there is no way to verify it with people shut into their homes. The only sounds coming from the street are the constant wail of ambulances, they said. Aouani had no choice other than to stay, but because he lives in an on-campus apartment, he needed to get permission from university officials. His roommate left, so currently Aouani lives on his own on south campus, about a mile and a half from the main campus. Without access to the facility or dining hall, he makes all of his meals and does all of his training on his own. According to Syracuse, there are about 12 student-athletes living in on-campus housing. More than half are international students. There are other student-athletes living off campus as well, including some from the track and field team. "It is really sad here," Aouani said. "It feels like it's summer. No one is around, and it doesn't feel like school is still going on. It is tough -- at least when you are with people, you can share the hardship much easier. Now it feels like you're alone in this situation. I think if I went earlier enough I would have been able to go home, but at this point it would be very hard, almost impossible. I thought it would be smart and better for me to stay here and focus on school and control what I can control from here." At Utah, students living in dorms were urged to leave campus if they had another place to go. Sophomore basketball player Niyah Becker, from Winnipeg, Canada, wanted to go home and see her family, but the logistics proved too difficult. Facing the prospect of a 14-day quarantine upon arrival and no timetable for a return because of current travel restrictions, she decided it would be best to stay. Teammate Julie Brosseau, from Quebec, felt the same way. So teammates helped each other out. Brosseau lives in an off-campus house with Maurane Corbin (also from Quebec) and Dru Gylten (from South Dakota). Gylten decided to go home, so Becker temporarily moved into her room in the house, packing up the necessities from her dorm room to make the short move. "We're really conscious of everywhere we go, what we touch, and when we come back in the house we spray ourselves down with Lysol and change our clothes and wash our hands a billion times a day," Becker said. "We try not to leave the house, and go out only if we need to." They go for runs outside, but do their workouts in the living room mainly, although they do have basketballs and practice their ballhandling in the driveway. To pass the time, they do crafts, puzzles and watch movies. Still, Brosseau has not entirely ruled out going back to Canada to see her family, and her back-and-forth "should I stay or should I go" just shows how hard it can be to make these choices. "I'm staying busy with my teammates, but I might go home in maybe a month just because I don't want to be in Utah for another year without seeing my family," Brosseau said. "I don't want to be stuck in Canada and not be able to come back to the U.S. That's why I'm still here and trying to figure out what to do." A little more than 500 miles to the east in Boulder, Colorado, skier Magnus Boee decided not to return home to Norway because of tighter restrictions in his home country, quarantine prospects and the fact that the eight-hour time difference would severely hamper his ability to join online classes. Plus, he noted, the weather is better in Colorado and he is able to get outside -- he recently went camping over a weekend. Of the 43 international student-athletes on Colorado rosters, 19 stayed in Boulder. Colorado athletics gave those athletes who stayed in town a gold card to buy groceries, which is equivalent to the cost of dining hall meals. The NCAA gave schools discretion to assist student-athletes with whatever is needed during this time period, including campus displacements (that also includes emergency travel). Boee lives off campus. One of his roommates left, but he has a temporary roommate -- a former Colorado skier from Estonia who arrived in the United States for World Cup ski races both here and in Canada. But with all that canceled, he is stuck in Boulder for the time being. Boee has found ways to pass the time beyond taking his classes, camping and doing his daily workouts. He just bought a guitar and said he plans to teach himself how to play. "It's not that fun being mostly isolated and not meeting with people," Boee said. "It's better for us skiers that we got to race almost our entire season, unlike lacrosse and a lot of spring sports that are all canceled. I don't complain about being in Boulder. I have everything I need right now -- that's why I'm staying." There are other international student-athletes who made the decision to stay -- just not on campus or its surrounding area. Syracuse forward Marek Dolezaj made the 16-hour drive with his girlfriend to her home in Springfield, Missouri, the weekend after the ACC and NCAA basketball tournaments were canceled -- both believing they would return to campus after spring break. But shortly after their arrival, they learned the campus was closing, so they remain in Missouri. Dolezaj, from Slovakia, heard stories about friends having a difficult time just making it back to their home country, so he opted against even trying. "For me, it's a 16-hour flight, but maybe some other international students have more problems finding a place to stay if the school tells you one day to leave and you have to figure stuff out," Dolezaj said. "I'm really lucky I have someone like my girlfriend to stay here and maybe other people don't have it. I could tell some of my friends were confused and stressed, and they didn't know what to do. It's a hard time for everyone." Among the five international players on the Syracuse basketball team, three are staying with friends in the United States and two went home. Syracuse field hockey coach Ange Bradley has seven international players on her roster -- including six from Europe. After the NCAA canceled the remainder of the season, her international players asked for advice. Syracuse was going out on spring break, and they didn't know whether they should still take their domestic trips with friends or go home. "I said you should pack up and plan like you're not coming back," Bradley said. "Get your ticket and go home is what I told them to do before this all blew up." Most went home. Two went to Miami for spring break before deciding to go back home. All seven now are in their home countries, providing some unique challenges. They were already home when campus shut down, so their American teammates got permission to clean out their dorm rooms, then split the cost of a storage unit for the gear they left behind. With immense time zone differences, Bradley had to figure out the best day and time to hold online meetings with the team, who are spread from Los Angeles to Berlin (4 p.m. ET seems to work best, she said). Several international players also have relatives who have contracted the coronavirus, adding to the stress and worry. "I'm happy that they're with their family," Bradley said. "We stay connected as part of the Syracuse field hockey family, and no matter how close or how far, we are always connected. I just think back to this -- they were making decisions to go hang out with domestic teammates for a week, and had they stayed with that decision it could have been four weeks, six weeks in someone else's house. It's still very surreal in a lot of ways." At UCLA, gymnast Pauline Tratz and diver Ruby Neave also decided to go home. The decisions were left entirely up to them. Tratz said she was hesitant to leave at first, but ultimately chose to return to Karlsruhe, Germany, to be closer to family. "It for sure was not easy for me because in the beginning I wanted this all to be not true," Tratz said in an email. "I wanted to be around my teammates and go through this difficult time with them, and I still thought that everything is going back to normal soon. However, after most of my teammates and all my roommates had already left, I realized that nothing is going to be back to normal soon. "The seriousness of this crisis with all its difficulties really hit me, and I was committed to doing my part to help the situation. This meant that going home and being with my family was the best decision." Tratz said she was worried about flying, unsure about the best safety precautions to take. After her first flight to Germany was canceled, she had to take another that connected through Newark, New Jersey. She said Los Angeles International airport was fairly empty, but she had a 3Â½ hour layover (in Newark) and was "was overwhelmed with the amount of people at the airport, waiting at their gate." Once she arrived in Germany, there were no additional screenings, and she did not have to self-isolate at home. It was different for Neave, who decided to go back to Melbourne, Australia, after her coach gave her the green light. She was required to go into 14-day isolation at her home, so she has been relegated to her bedroom. She has her own bathroom, gloves and mask and eats separately from her family. "It has been very strange, going from such a structured lifestyle to having all this time to literally do nothing," Neave said. "But I've been doing some painting, trying to learn some new songs on the piano and watching lots of movies." The abrupt end to the season was especially difficult. Neave missed her first two seasons at UCLA after undergoing back surgery. This season, her first for the Bruins, she qualified for the NCAA championships in both 1-meter and 3-meter events. Before the team went its separate ways, coaches took all those who qualified for NCAAs out to breakfast. "We were all a little bit confused on how to feel -- at the breakfast we knew that would be it, after that point, a lot of people were leaving that day to go home," Neave said. "It was strange, but at the same time it was nice, and I think we all got closure from it. The coaches gave a nice speech and told us how proud they were of us in getting to where we were." It took Colorado golfer John Paterson nearly a full day to return home to St. Andrews, Scotland. He had to take three flights, including one through New York. Since arriving home, he has been isolating in his room. His family leaves food at the door for him. "It was an easy decision for me, my family wanted me home for obvious reasons, and I wanted to go home also," Paterson said. "It's a challenging time for everyone, and I think being able to face it with your family is the best route. "I'm going to return probably a week before school restarts in the fall. I have no real reason to be back in the U.S. with no academic or athletic responsibilities. Hopefully, this will all improve, and we can start the 2020-2021 season as planned."

We all need to wear mask! We are attacking killing other. If everyone wore mask it wouldn't be spreading and the hospital wouldn't be overwhelmed with us. Sending all the masks to the hospitals and none for the people that killing each other is ludicrous. We can't buy mask, and we don't have lysol spray or towels for the people the enemy is infecting. The government need to start providing and mandating that EVERYONE wear mask to prevent us from killing each other. The Task Force can't be that stupid that they can't see what the virus is doing and how we are killing each other without masks. Now we see why everyone in China is wearing mask, to prevent them from murdering each other. Everyone staying home is not going to slow it down...because u have to come for something, and when u do the enemy is waiting on u!!!

Yeah I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t worried about it either until someone in our small town got it and they still arenÃ¢Â€Â™t all wearing gloves. They bought all the Lysol. Before this outbreak people were trying to buy full cases of Lysol TO DRINK. And now I canÃ¢Â€Â™t even get any for the intended purpose. Like maybe if these fuckers didnÃ¢Â€Â™t DRINK it theyÃ¢Â€Â™d have some already! I have no spray disinfectant. If I sit in my momÃ¢Â€Â™s car I want to spray the chair down with it. My mom had to travel so she went into every open Walmart to get me a switch and idk if I have a fever or if itÃ¢Â€Â™s just hot! IÃ¢Â€Â™m sweating and work and feeling a little weird but there is NOTHING I can do about it right now, I probably wonÃ¢Â€Â™t even get the money I should have when I was home for two weeks already. I was saving for a car and now IÃ¢Â€Â™ll have negative money. If I give my mom COVID IÃ¢Â€Â™m gonna hate myself and neither of us will survive it because of lung and kidney disease. Some people are just oblivious about the whole thing and at work they gave us pagers and IÃ¢Â€Â™m not using mine. Earpiece keeps falling off my ear. What exactly is the point of wearing masks, gloves and putting the barriers up on the till if I have to touch my ear every 5 seconds it falls off? Literally the dumbest time to roll out pagers.

I have given hundreds - if not THOUSANDS of these drugs to my patients over tbe years without a SINGLE PROBLEM other than 1 allergic reaction in a 10 year old child which I had standing orders from our facility doctor to treat immediately without having to call him. The child was fine and observed for any further reaction for 24 hours and her medical records changed to show she had an allergy to Azithromycin. These 2 drugs are available WORLDWIDE and they are CHEAP. The scientists in FRANCE found in the lab that they WORKED to slow progression of the virus. The French put this immediately to patients who were gonna die anyway without something. It WORKED in ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the patients it was tried on !! 100% ! This news was spread across the WORLD! But, IT IS NOT A CURE !!! It is a SUCESSFUL treatment plan when a patient is worsening and there is no other choice. They aren't just handing this stuff out to everyone, it's used only ON THE VERY SICK. THEY WILL DIE WITH NO TREATMENT. Do you UNDERSTAND THIS? DEATH IS PERMANENT. When it is YOU dying you will be happy to take it ! President Trump didn't even say things the way this video shows. These are CLIPS if his actual press gathering that have been put together to make it appear like he's trying to say he knows better. This happens ALL THE TIME. We know it but you people that hate him SO BAD, won't even GO AND WATCH THE REAL VIDEO. I am NOT GONNA TAKE ANYONES OPINION , ever. I ALWAYS INVESTIGATE FOR MYSELF. But with FIVE CHILDREN I PROMISE YOU if one of them got sick with this I would #1 keep them at home and treat their minor symptoms #2 allow a MILD fever to progress without medicine and watch for high fever ( over 101.9- 102 ) but still avoid the use of ibuprofen as reports coming in say that it can make some more succeptible to this virus.I have been trying to find EXACTLY WHY.I would be VERY CERTAIN to Keep them hydrated with fluids and allow rest for the body to recover. I would still encourage deep breathing and coughing to prevent a standard pneumonia from setting in. #3 Notify our doctor IMMEDIATELY upon the event of heavy congestion, shortness of breath, or any sign of impending respiratory distress. #4 If our doctor is unavailable then I would take them to the hospital and warn them I am coming so that precautions can be taken. I would only call an ambulance if the shortness of breath has progressed to the point that oxygen is needed immediately. #5 Once my child has been examined I would request these 2 medications to be given ASAP. Our home has an ultraviolet air cleaner built into an Air Purifier. We also have a 70 pint dehumidifier that I clean DAILY with bleach ( I personally only use Clorox) These 2 machines run 24/7 unless I'm cleaning it. When the sun is shining our front door is open and the screen glass removed. Our opposite windows are also open to allow for fresh air exchange. If there's no breeze, then I have a small fan in the opposite window blowing air OUT and a small personal size fan pulling air in. I hang dry our freshly laundered clothes out in the sun and launder our pillow cases and bed linens every 3 days with 1/4 cup bleach in the wash. Our regular laundry gets 1 full cup of white vinegar( large loads) in the rinse water I keep 2 bottles of 2oz bleach + 20 oz water, and I spray the hard surfaces in the house 3x a day and allow them to air dry. I bought 2 bottles of 91% isopropyl alcohol (because it takes less) and I used old hairspray bottles to mix 2 oz alcohol to 20 oz water for emergency hand treatment if water is inaccessible. 1 is in tbe car and 1 is out on the porch. The porch one is used on doorknobs, hands BEFORE entering the house. Jackets and shoes stay outside and I put 2 cheap plastic 3 hook hangers on the wall outside the back porch door. There is a $3.44 plastic rubbermaid type lidded box for our shoes with a bottle of Lysol spray disinfectant there for germ killing inside the container. Each of my kids have a clip on alcohol gel that is HOMEMADE. I used leftover small size Dawn dish detergent bottles and mixed a blend of that same 91% alcohol and aloe vera gel. I wrapped a thick rubber band around the cap and attached a small carabineer clip. I wash all our fruit and vegetables with 30% vinegar + water and I spray EVERYTHING that is carried in bags to my car with the vinegar water too that has a couple of drops of lemon oil in it. EVERY MORINING as soon as we are all up we wash up,brush teeth put toothbrushes and personal items like razors in a pencil box that each child has. We meet in tbe kitchen and each of us has a glass of orange juice,a vitamin D3,a 400 mg Magnesium tablet, and an Omega 3 and a CoQ10. The first 3 I'd these are considered the " Antiviral Trifecta" according to medical reports they help prevent the body's vulnerability to virus INCLUDING Covid19. After that and IMMEDIATELY before we eat we consume an amino acid capsule AND a Digestive Enzymes capsule,as your Digestive System is your first line of defense. All this stuff like Clorox,white vinegar, lemon oil, carabineer clips, rubber bands, dish liquid, etc came from Dollar tree. As did the D3 and digestive enzymes. We also take a B complex available there.No expensive stuff. ALL OF THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR US, BUT FOR ANYONE WE MAY COME INTO CONTACT WITH !!! If we keep OURSELVES healthy then we have done ðŸ’¯ % of OUR JOB as GOOD CITIZENS ! If WE STAY HEALTHY - YOU STAY HEALTHY â™¥ï¸ SO, stop all the BS about Pres. Trump. Stop the fighting, Stop the HATRED ! EVERY SINGLE PERSON ALLOWING THE MEDIA TO UPSET THEM IS RAISING YOUR CORTISOL LEVELS AND OPENING YOURSELF AND EVERYONE AROUND YOU TO THIS VIRUS. IF YOU WANT TO BLAME SOMEONE FOR MISINFORMATION AND PLAYING WITH YOUR LIFE --- LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE MEDIA OUTLETS !!! I've banned them all except the EPOCH TIMES. They are the ONLY Media Source that ISN'T ONE SIDED ! Good luck to you and your family. Think about what I've said here. I'm not Trump crazy but I respect him as our PRESIDENT. I love my Country and I'm sick of seeing it torn down. The guy might really do some great things if he didn't have to spend so much time fighting to do his job. Think about it. Please.

@LastOfTheAnalog @gang4610 @kathrynacullen You are correct that lysol contains petroleum byproducts. Ethanol is just drinking alcohol and if you can get 60%-95% (120 to 190 proof vodka) that would work great.

A strict quarantine is a good way to learn about your partner, and what Sara Hudson has learned is that her husband, Daniel, the Nationalsâ€™ closer, does not know how to use a Lysol wipe. â€œYou have to do it for a good 20 seconds for it to work!â€ Sara says. Daniel tends to give the contents of a grocery bag one pass and then put them away. In Saraâ€™s view, he might as well just walk the food through a hospitalâ€™s isolation ward before serving it to their three daughters. She laughs and says, â€œIâ€™m just like, â€˜Iâ€™ll do it.â€™ â€ As the coronavirus pandemic has spread across the globe, and the MLB season has been suspended, players are home, waiting out this uneasy period like the rest of us. Unlike the record 6.6 million Americans who filed for unemployment during the week ending March 28, many of these players enjoy a financial cushion. They do not draw paychecks until the season begins, but the average major leaguer made $4.36 million last year, according to the Associated Press. Still, they are frightened and unsettled. They are struggling to establish some sense of normalcy during the least normal stage of their lives. Some of them are also driving their wives crazy. Itâ€™s a small aggravation, nothing compared with the real devastation that the virus has caused. Ali Mahtook tries to find the humor in it. Her husband, Mikie, is a Phillies outfielder. He canâ€™t go to work, but she still does, as a liquor representative for bars and restaurants in Baton Rouge. As many of those businesses have closed, her company has redeployed resources toward retailâ€”meaning that while everyone around her is socially distancing, Ali is at local supermarkets and convenience stores, stocking shelves. When she gets home, she has emails to answer and data to enter.

As for the scarce 3M N95 mask, it can be sprayed with Lysol spray (if you can find any Lysol spray in the stores). Unfortunately people began hoarding the masks right after the pandemic was publicized in China. Some of us, who were in NYC in January and February, and then, subsequently were sick with flu-like symptoms for 2 to 3 weeks are still unable to receive an antibody titer tests. Right now, it's easier to have one's pet dog or dogs tested at the local animal hospital. Without massive weekly testing, where everyone is tested each week for several consecutive weeks, we're going to be in total lockdown. You know who to blame for the lack of testing. Hint: He's big and fat, plus he disbanded the pandemic team and also gutted the CDC. As you know, many of the federal government senior positions are still unfilled. Also many doctors and scientists were fired in the process of drastically cutting the government budget to further facilitate the unprecedented tax cuts for the wealthy and multinational corporations, which continue to serve the general public during a catastrophe. For some reason, the CDC along with the FDA insists on a 3-step testing kit, while successful countries like Germany are using a 2-step test. Faculty members of the Mailman School of Public Health at the Columbia University are using the 2-step test, which will not be approved by the FDA during the Trump administration. This peculiar situation stems from Jared Kushner's role in finding for-profit corporations to disseminate the tests. Until an acceptable for-profit corporation is able to create a viable 3-step test, we'll be living in Hell. Those, who were already infected, will never know, thanks to .... Guess who? Meanwhile the shelves are not being restocked at the stores, which is extremely strange -- don't you think? There's no tissues, no flushable wipes, no toilet paper for the most part, no paper towels, no peroxide, no Lysol spray, no alcohol, no masks, no disposable vinyl gloves in the stores. Some of the stores are restocking on ice cream and pink slime chopped meat along with the cheaper, inferior qualities of red meat and pork loaded with ractopamine. Outside of the Wegmans grocery stores, you will notice a line of severely and morbidly obese mammoths waiting on line -- one after the other without social distancing. These are the very people, who will die of COVID-19, because of the layers of fatty tissue surrounding their organs like the lungs, heart, pancreas, and liver. When a person is significantly overweight, they are definitively and definitely diabetic. They also have severe hypertension. You will notice that their legs are notably or severely swollen. I've seen morbidly obese diabetics with false limbs loading up their vans, SUVs with groceries at Wegmans. Wegmans is the amusement park for the obese. There are local police at each entrance and in the store, but they're not wearing masks -- and they're actually approaching shoppers, who enter the store, quite closely. In other words, the local police are not heeding to the protocol of six feet. If a person doesn't understand one of the police officer's dialect or colloquial local language, the police officer steps inside of the 6 feet. It's just unbelievable! Avoid Wegmans like the plague. In this case, it's COVID-19.

buddyd157 said: â†‘ i went to my local walmart this morning. they open at 6 AM on tuesdays, for us seniors. i'd say there was at least 40 of us in line, not bad at all, in fact, everyone started talking to one another about a few things. when the doors open, we filed in, in a single row, and the guy was spraying any carriages we took in, with anti-bacterial, i even had him spray my hands. why not? so we all went about our shopping business, no one pushing or shoving or grabbing items off the shelves in a panic. who ever wanted TP or paper towels, had to form yet another line at the back of the store where the stock room is, and the employee's doled out ONE per customer. got to the cashier, a lady that i know, in fact, when you go to walmart as often as i do, you get to know everyone by name.. very orderly, respectful, and easy going shopping. i think some people are just plain jerks in life, in general. it's those people that we all know, that ruin things for everyone else. we will get thru this in time, and i don't think or believe that we will be any worse for wear. it's the jerks that in time, Karma will take care of them, and when that happens, i hope i get to witness that, and frankly, LOL....!!! Yeah. I went today too. I got there about 5:30 and me and another guy were in the front of the line under this covered thing up front. Good thing too because it started raining. They ended up letting everyone in about 8 minutes early. Had plenty of TP but no paper towels. Was pretty orderly. I asked the WM lady about the 5 people for every 1000 sq ft of store space. Told me the store was almost 150,000 sq ft and that they could hold 749 people before they had to stop anyone from coming in.
buddyd157 said: â†‘ well this too depends on the "social distancing" the smaller places keep up with.with smaller stores, means less people inside. One store put squares on the floor in the entire place. Then assigned three staff cowboys to seperate us when we herd at the meat line, milk line and bread line. Not that it matters, all three lines were stripped. For the most part all of us did good. Stay on this sqaure or that square. They also walled off cashiers with plexiglass so you can scatter spittle on it while making small talk. (Ugh...) take a bus and a taxi around to the far side to get your change.

courtesy wikimedia commonsA tiger at the Bronx zoo tested positive for Covid-19. It is believed that one of the zookeepers transmitted the disease to the tiger. It is also being reported that the zookeeper was an asymptomatic carrier. Do not freak out. It is not a secret that animals can become infected with some human diseases. The issue is that there is no indication that a cat or dog can infect humans with Covid-19. The dog or cat, even if becoming infected appears to be a dead-end host. Zoos all over are putting protocols in place, most of which echo those that your spcaLA has been sharing with you all along to keep yourselves and our pets safe. Additionally, spcaLA has been collaborating with veterinarians, infectious disease experts and representatives from around the world to share vital information and current best practices with our constituents and other shelter professionals. It bears repeating here: Guidance for Pet Owners Pets are members of the family, and just like human family members, spcaLA urges pet owners to protect pets. If dog parks are still open in your area, spcaLA urges pet parents to avoid them. Maintain good hygiene practices by washing hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching pets, in keeping with CDC guidelines. Do not allow your dogs to play with other dogs or meet people during daily walks. Keep a six-foot distance between your dog and others, just as you would with other people. Curb your dogâ€™s interest in sniffing excrement of other animals, or picking up refuse on the ground. Before you come inside from a walk, wipe your dogâ€™s paws with a sudsy solution of pet shampoo and water. When finished, discard the wipe and thoroughly rinse your petâ€™s paws with water to remove soap residue. If you have them available, you may consider having your dog wear shoes, socks, or booties outdoors. Keep your cats and other pets safely indoors. If you are unable to confine your cat, follow the wipe down procedures indicated above. Do not use Lysol wipes, bleach, or other harsh chemicals on your pets. Ask your veterinarian for additional safe options to clean your petâ€™s paws. Guidance for Animal Care Facilities Protect your staff and volunteers. Determine and implement your shelterâ€™s intake procedures, which should apply to returning fosters and other clients, as well as stray and surrendered pets. Protect the community. Determine and implement your shelterâ€™s procedures prior to placing animals in adoption, foster, or returning them to their owners. Pet boarding and daycare facilities, many of whom are open and caring for the pets of medical, grocery, sanitation, food delivery, and other essential workers, should take care to develop and implement intake and return procedures. Protocols for incoming and outgoing animals may include bathing (paying special attention to the areas most frequently petted by people), a period of isolation, and other actions. Further consideration should be made as to PPE for staff and procedures to accept or return animals to the public while maintaining safe social distance. We will continue to monitor the science and refer you to reputable sites for information . Please see the Center for Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization ,American Veterinary Medical Association , andWorld Organization for Animal Health . Please stay safe!

Every time any of us has had the â€œflu,â€ itâ€™s CORONAVIRUS. Look on the back of your Lysol can, it states it kills, â€œCoronavirus.â€ This is a strain of the coronavirus. Probably man made w illustrious intentions of mass destruction, WW. Look around, itâ€™s been a tsunami, almost WW.

Looking back itâ€™s hard to remember, but they says itâ€™s November, 17th 2019, & ever since been, bat shit crazy, cats & dogs bark at, rotten meat at the Wuhan Market, ya thatâ€™s right, made in China! Spreadin that Corona shit faster then their population, mutation, infection, every one jump in their cars, this is much worse then SARS. Letâ€™s all travel to Italy, cuz I heard itâ€™d be, deadly if they all start coughin, & end up stackin up lotsa coffin. You know who else has no notion?, is all the people stuck out in the ocean, sea sick cuz of the motion, there is no vaccine or magic potion. So letâ€™s keep going, & rowing our way over to North America, in Canada & the big USeh!? It was a full moon & FRIDAY the 13th when we all went crazy & smashed thru the door of every grocery store, they were in shock & didnâ€™t smile when they all started to stock pile! Some one please explain this toilet paper shit before I piss my self, empty shelf, people acting meaner, leavin us with no cleaner, trip & fall over the lack of Lysol, shoppers thinkin their wiser, instead being a miser, hoarding all the hand sanitizer. This isnâ€™t cool, but here it goes, all the schools close cuz thatâ€™s what the government chose. New York State of emergency, once again ground zero, front line health care lookin like hero. Build the wall & close the border, on Trumpâ€™s order! This disease is sounding worse then Miley Cyrus, so crack a beer coronavirus. The media is on big screen, watching people lookin green, call this thing COVID-19, Weâ€™re all havin to leave town & lock down, quarantine. This isnâ€™t 2 weeks vacation itâ€™s 14 days of isolation, Hopfully not cabin fever. WHO set the ground rules ? World Health Organization, thatâ€™s WHO! For what I seen, seemed like general hygiene, so before this germ lands, wash your hands, with lotsa love, make sure to wear the glove, & for your next task disinfect with alcohol from your flask, donâ€™t forget to strap on that mask! Then all of a sudden in an Instance they asked us to keep our distance.

Lysol spray takes 10 minutes to kill coronavirus apparently. So my spraying down shopping carts and citibike handles and immediately using them may not have provided the protection I had hoped for....

MIAMI (CBSMiami) â€“ Hundreds of temporary apartment units in Miami have been donated to the staff at Jackson Health System who are fighting the coronavirus pandemic. â€œI think every nurse is fearful but theyâ€™re doing best job they possibly can,â€ said Carla Calonge, a nurse in the emergency department at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Nurses and other health care workers like Calonge have expressed their fear of getting infected and bringing that infection back home to their loved ones. â€œItâ€™s actually been very difficult. Iâ€™ve had to get undressed in my car, spray Lysol, put my clothes in a bag, straight in the laundry, jump straight to a hot shower,â€ explained Calonge. â€œIâ€™m fearful [of exposing] anyone I love.â€ Calongeâ€™s daughter is also in the health care field, working as a senior ER technician at the pediatric emergency department at Holtz Childrenâ€™s Hospital. Worrying about where to sleep is just one of many challenges health care workers have been facing while fighting this virus on the frontlines. â€œYou and I are so stressed in our homes, imagine how frontline workers feel in their heightened state of stress,â€ said city of Miami commissioner Ken Russell. â€œThey want to go home and relax but they canâ€™t. They feel theyâ€™re bringing this home with them.â€ But now thanks to the Jose Milton Family and United Property Management, 295 apartments, fully furnished, have been donated. Utilities will also be free. The apartments will be available for 30 days, with weekly extensions as required. The overall donation amounts to 2.2 million dollars. â€œIt gives me piece of mind,â€ said Calonge. â€œI donâ€™t have to bring potentially disease home to loved ones [and Iâ€™m] grateful for the opportunity to stay there.â€ Recently, Russell had also put together a meals program with Uber Eats for 2500 nurses and doctors also at Jackson Health System. He hopes to bring people who can help with people who need the help together. However, there is a need for more places to stay like these apartments. Commissioner Russell said the 295 apartments were filled up within 3 days. â€œWe canâ€™t meet that capacity. Just a small dent in that problem,â€ said Russell, asking for those who have housing capabilities to step up.â€

One day take a look at a can of Lysol spray and read it. It kills a lot of germs/viruses including foreign viruses. Next year it will have to add COVID19. #TheStory
One of the first things to sell out across the country due to mass panic buying was disinfecting wipes. These Lysol wipes are now very hard to come by. But that does not mean they are not essential. These wipes can work wonders when it comes to killing

Publix has them in the most butt dumb place. Right in front of the register. Not to the side where people ACTUALLY interact with the cashier. Lots of gas stations have them set up properly, though.
Quote: Originally Posted by Lee A Stewart I carry very little cash on hand but there are still places that don't take cards, like local restaurants. Any paper money I receive as change, particularly from my neighborhood Chinese takeout joint, I spray with either Lysol or rubbing alcohol. Loose change I may leave lying around if it's less than a buck. Pennies definitely stay behind lol. I've left some loose change behind at Transit ticket kiosks. It's just too risky to grab money from those germ infested dispensers. I'm probably a boon to the homeless who have almost completely taken over these buildings I spray Lysol on all personal incoming Amazon packaging I receive before tearing them open. I sometimes even spray Lysol on the contents. Who knows who has touched my stuff. I don't worry too much about viruses attaching themselves to my jeans or hoodies. I spray them down with Lysol when I get home sometimes but I don't have the energy to stick to a regiment of wipedowns and trips to the Laundromat on a daily basis. Thank goodness I have a limited wardrobe. Now we're supposed to wipe down food containers from supermarkets and delivery takeout As far as masks, I've re-used the ones I've purchased at the corner store a couple times. I'm careful not to touch the masks while I'm in the wild and I spray them with Lysol after each use but I was never 100% confident these measures were very effective. I've been waking up sweaty at night whenever I go the bathroom and in the mornings - has anyone seen excessive sweating being mentioned as a symptom of coronavirus? I had an EKG about a year ago and other than a bit of age-related wear and tear on a valve, my heart seems to be in good shape. I've also been getting tension headaches more frequently. Ambient room temperature can't be a factor since we've been having mild weather lately and I haven't had to turn on the heater.
Raise your hand if you understand what proper disinfecting means. I bet no one actually reads the bleach and Lysol labels. Thatâ€™s why this God- Forsaken virus is way out of hand! READ THE LABEL AMD STAY SAFE EVERYONE ðŸ™ðŸ¼

The assistance, â€œLive for currently, dwell in the instant, never maintain pining for the fantastic ol' daysâ€ has often rung correct for me, but in this time of quarantine and isolation, it is an adage that means extra now than at any time. We hear stories from our mom and dad or grandparents of more simple occasions, of slower-paced times. We hear tales of a world wherever neighbors realized each other, when bread was only 25 cents a loaf and a new car or truck expense an unbelievable $5,900. â€œThose were the times!â€ we may assume to ourselves. I suspect we have all expert moments of such nostalgia to some diploma. Nevertheless, though I sit producing these thoughts, I'm stunned to obtain myself sensation nostalgic for instances merely a few weeks in the past. I see pre-quarantine photographs of mates in a team hug or substantial choirs singing with each other or multigenerational birthday celebrations for a fantastic-grandfather, and I think, â€œMan, I recall that! Wow, these good instances! How I prolonged for these very good ol' days!â€ Our world â€” our way of dwelling, really â€” has improved drastically, and the differences in between lifestyle as it was a thirty day period in the past as opposed to life as it is now are grand in scale. We can, and really should, mourn the loss of owning the skill to acquire en masse without the need of anxiety of both spreading or contracting COVID-19. That grieving can truly be effective as it allows us respect what we may have taken for granted in the previous: the pretty rational expectation of becoming able to find bathroom paper or Lysol wipes at the keep our ability to engage in, sing, share, converse with just about every other devoid of worry the independence to only sit beside our close friends devoid of stressing about our health. And still, in this immediate â€” appropriate now â€” we have the potential to make this very working day a single of the very good ol' days by getting the sunshine in the storm, by realizing that getting ready to devote a quantity of time (and ideally high quality time, as very well) with our families is a treasure. We have the reward of keeping beloved ones close through technological innovation. We can come to a decision that the unexpected opportunity to prioritize our lifetime plans is a silver lining. Of course, that is easier mentioned than accomplished our hearts may possibly be carrying very hefty burdens. But our mind-set and our outlook can, in the conclude, make these times some of â€œthe excellent ol' days.â€ I'm attempting to acquire a cue from one of our nationwide treasures, Irving Berlin, who once claimed, â€œOur attitudes manage our lives. Attitudes are a mystery ability functioning 20-four hrs a day, for good or negative. It is of paramount value that we know how to harness and manage this fantastic force.â€ That we have clear, managing drinking water, a roof around our heads, a box of cereal in the cabinet, and electric power to mild our properties make this a great ol' working day. The likelihood that new, impressive means of treating diseases will be learned in the wake of this storm would make this a great ol' working day. Basically remaining alive would make this a excellent ol' working day. Each and every just one of us truly have the ability to make right now a excellent ol' working day, and my want is that we make it so. Deon Sagers lives in Cedar Hills.

You literally just need to have a visible toilet paper roll, canister of Lysol wipes, or hand sanitizer in your car to put it at serious risk of being broken into #COVID19
You want to know where to buy hand sanitizer and are having trouble finding it, huh? Well, supply is at an all-time low, and finding it can be quite difficult. People are buying up all the essentials, and hand sanitizer is one of the hardest things to find right now. It's crucial in keeping your hands clean, so you'll want to have some for sure. As a result of this, not only is the supply really low, but the few that are in stock have seen prices rise from third-party sellers who are gobbling them up and reselling. Amazon has started cracking down on the price surge, but that isn't helping with the supply issues. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a pandemic, and health officials are warning that things will only get worse over the coming days before they get any better. It is advised that you wash your hands regularly with antibaterial soap for a minimum of 20 seconds, but in addition, hand sanitizer is a great way to keep the germs off your hands while out and about. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using an alcohol-based sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol in it. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has a list of recommended cleaning products that you should be using. Where to buy hand sanitizer today Target: Drive up service optional Home Depot: A secret weapon Office Depot: The most variety CVS: Online inventory is re-stocked!

With supplies at an all-time low you are probably wondering where you can find some hand sanitizer for yourself.

Shop hand sanitizer at Target Similar to Walmart, Target has a lot of stores across the U.S, making it easy to get your hands on some hand sanitizer the same day. Unfortunately, most of the stores look like supplies are pretty low, but we'd imagine they are receiving shipments and working to get them unloaded as quickly as possible. You can opt for in-store pickup or drive-up service where available, and thanks to its Shipt partnership Target can also offer same-day delivery in many areas, though there is a fee for the service. Target Shop hand sanitizer at Target Target offers free in-store pickup, drive-up services, and even same-day delivery via Shipt in select areas. It's a great way to get your hands on some hand sanitizer quickly. Home Depot carries more than just tools When you think of Home Depot you probably think of tools, lumber, and outdoor supplies, but you may be pleasantly surprised to know that the retailer also carries hand sanitizer. Since it's not the first place people will think to look, stock levels at your local stores may be higher than they are at places like Walmart, Target, and others. Home Depot Shop hand sanitizer at Home Depot It won't be long before everyone catches on and starts looking at Home Depot, so be sure to check the supply now and grab some for yourself. Try Office Depot as well You may not have thought to try something like Office Depot for hand, but similar to Home Depot, it's a great resource that's worth checking out.

Orders ship for free if you buy $35 or more worth of items, with CarePass members getting free shipping on any eligible items.

CVS Shop hand sanitizer at CVS CVS's online inventory is currently plentiful, making this one of the easiest places to buy hand sanitizer from. If you prefer shopping in-store, your nearest CVS location should also have you covered. We will continue to update this list as we see availability from other retailers.

Shop hand sanitizer at Walmart Walmart has a big advantage over Amazon here in that it has thousands of stores spread across the United States, which means no waiting for something to be shipped to you. Stock varies by store location, though you can often times order it online and pick it up in-store for free, which means you don't have to look all over the place at the store for it, and it guarantees that the stock will be there for you. You can also have some of them shipped to the house, but inventory there is quite limited. Walmart Shop hand sanitizer at Walmart Shop online, pick up in-store.
