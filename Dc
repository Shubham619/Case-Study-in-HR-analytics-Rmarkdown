Background – Slide 1: Transformer Workloads and Memory Pressure
	•	Modern transformer models used in GenAI inference and training are dominated by large matrix multiplications at every layer and token step.
	•	Each step requires access to large weight matrices, activations, KV cache, and (during training) optimizer state.
	•	Fast local memory on accelerators (such as HBM or on-chip SRAM) provides high bandwidth but is limited in capacity.
	•	As model sizes grow, the complete working set can no longer remain resident in fast local memory.

⸻

Background – Slide 2: Reliance on Pooled / Shared Memory
	•	To overcome local memory limits, systems increasingly rely on pooled or shared memory tiers, such as peer accelerator memory, host DRAM, memory appliances, or disaggregated memory fabrics.
	•	These pooled memory tiers have higher access latency, lower effective bandwidth, and are often shared across multiple accelerators or tenants.
	•	Access latency and contention in pooled memory vary dynamically, making data arrival times unpredictable.
	•	Naïve movement of entire layers or large contiguous chunks from pooled memory leads to inefficient bandwidth use.

⸻

Background – Slide 3: Limitations of Existing Approaches
	•	Existing systems typically move weights at coarse granularity (entire layers or large blocks), causing overfetch and unnecessary data transfer.
	•	When required data arrives late, compute engines stall, increasing tail latency during inference and reducing utilization during training.
	•	Prefetching mechanisms are usually best-effort and cache-oriented, without explicit deadlines or cancellation when data is no longer useful.
	•	Most approaches require full dense weights to be locally present before computation, limiting overlap between compute and memory transfer.

⸻

Background – Slide 4: Additional Challenges in Distributed and Training Settings
	•	In distributed inference, multiple accelerators may fetch the same data redundantly due to lack of coordination, wasting pooled-memory bandwidth.
	•	Training introduces stricter correctness constraints, requiring all needed parameters and optimizer state to be present before backward propagation or synchronization.
	•	Current systems lack a unified mechanism to balance bandwidth across weights, KV cache growth, and optimizer state under shared constraints.
	•	These challenges motivate a new execution model that allows computation to proceed with partial data, while ensuring bounded latency, efficient bandwidth use, and deterministic correctness.

Below is a complete, verbose, end-to-end “Detailed Description” story (spec-style) that explicitly includes your math and walks through the full operation (F1–F16) in the order a machine actually performs it. I’m treating “pooled/shared memory” as any pooling facility (peer accelerator memory, host DRAM, appliance, disaggregated fabric, etc.).

⸻

Detailed Description of the Invention (Complete Story with Math)

0) System context and components

The system comprises one or more accelerators (processors) with:
	1.	Fast local memory (e.g., HBM or any low-latency high-bandwidth local memory),
	2.	Pooled/shared memory tier providing large capacity but with higher latency and lower effective bandwidth, often contended,
	3.	Compute engines for matrix operations,
	4.	A managed tile cache in fast local memory,
	5.	A tile directory (local or distributed) that tracks tile location/version/in-flight status,
	6.	A scheduler/arbiter that enforces per-step traffic budgets and priorities across transfer classes (weights, optional KV/state, optimizer),
	7.	Runtime telemetry (measured bandwidth, queue depth, latency statistics) used for ETA prediction and control,
	8.	Optional learning module to update tile scoring based on observed outcomes.

⸻

1) Offline or load-time preparation: cross-tier decomposition (F1)

For each transformer dense layer weight matrix W \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, the system produces a cross-tier representation:
W = B + UV^\top,
\quad
B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n},\
U\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\
V\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times r}.
Here:
	•	B is the base component chosen to remain resident in fast local memory to guarantee immediate compute start.
	•	U,V are low-rank factors stored in pooled/shared memory to provide capacity scaling.

The rank r can be chosen per layer, based on a memory budget and acceptable residual error (for example, selecting r such that the base captures most energy while leaving the remainder expressible as rank-slices).

This step ensures the system never requires full dense W to be fetched into fast memory.

⸻

2) Tile formation: addressable rank-slices (F2)

To make the pooled portion fine-grained and individually retrievable, the system expresses the low-rank term as rank-slices:
UV^\top x = \sum_{i=1}^{r} u_i\,(v_i^\top x),
where u_i is the i-th column of U and v_i is the i-th column of V.

Each slice i becomes a rank-slice tile:
	•	payload: (u_i, v_i) (possibly quantized/compressed),
	•	metadata: \text{tile\_id}, bytes, version, location pointers, optional importance order, and transform descriptors.

The system stores B in fast local memory (or ensures it can be quickly pinned there at model load), and stores tiles (u_i,v_i) in pooled/shared memory.

⸻

3) Managed tile cache and selective staging policy (F3)

The system reserves a region in fast local memory as an HBM/local tile cache.
This cache is explicitly managed: tiles are staged into it only when selected. The cache is typically sized to hold only a small fraction of all tiles per layer, so the system is forced to be selective and budget-driven rather than “fetch everything.”

⸻

4) Per-step control: traffic budget and deadline definition (F4, F5)

Execution proceeds in steps (per token, per layer, or both). For each step, the system defines a commit goal:
	•	Deadline T: commit must happen no later than time T for that step.
	•	Traffic budget B_{\text{bytes}}: maximum bytes allowed to be staged or in-flight during the step.
Optionally, the budget can be partitioned into classes (e.g., UV tiles vs optional KV/state vs optimizer-state tiles), but the essential requirement is that transfers remain within a bounded budget to avoid spikes and contention amplification.

This is the core mechanism that keeps execution predictable under pooled-memory variability.

⸻

5) Immediate base compute: provisional output starts without waiting (F10 foundation)

Given input activation x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}, the system immediately computes:
y_0 = Bx.
This is done entirely from fast local memory and therefore does not depend on pooled-memory arrival.

As tiles arrive, the system incrementally refines:
y_k = y_0 + \sum_{i\in S_k} u_i\,(v_i^\top x),
where S_k denotes the set of tiles that have arrived and have been applied so far.

This equation is the non-materializing execution form: no dense W is reconstructed, and Bx is computed once.

⸻

6) Quality signals computed during the step (F6)

From the current provisional output (typically logits in inference), the system computes a stability margin:
m = p(\text{top1}) - p(\text{top2}),
which measures how confident the step’s decision is (larger m indicates more stable next-token choice).

The system also computes an error proxy over missing tiles. Let:
M = \{1,\dots,r\}\setminus S_k
be the missing tiles not yet applied. Then:
E = \sum_{i\in M} \|u_i\|\cdot |v_i^\top x|.
Interpretation: E is a proxy upper bound on the remaining additive contribution from tiles that have not yet been fetched/applied. It can be used as a stopping certificate: when E is small, missing tiles are unlikely to change the output meaningfully.

⸻

7) Commit/stop rule (F5, F6)

The system commits output for the step under the following rule:
\text{Commit if }(m\ge \tau)\ \text{or }(E\le \varepsilon)\ \text{or }(t\ge T),
where \tau is a stability threshold, \varepsilon is an error tolerance, and t is the current time.

This rule ensures:
	•	early commit when decision is stable,
	•	commit when residual uncertainty is bounded,
	•	guaranteed commit by deadline T.

⸻

8) Candidate tile construction and benefit-per-byte scoring (F7)

If commit conditions are not met and budget/time remains, the system forms a candidate set of missing tiles and scores each by expected benefit per byte:

\text{score}_i \approx \frac{\Delta m_i}{\text{bytes}_i}
\quad\text{and/or}\quad
\frac{\Delta E_i}{\text{bytes}_i}.

A practical proxy for error reduction is:
\Delta E_i \approx \|u_i\|\cdot |v_i^\top x|,
leading to a simple scoring rule:
\text{score}_i = \frac{\|u_i\|\cdot |v_i^\top x|}{\text{bytes}_i}.

In implementations, the system may avoid computing v_i^\top x for all tiles by using inexpensive predictors, cached projections, or previously observed counterfactual values. The objective is to rank tiles by expected impact per transferred byte.

⸻

9) Joint set selection under budget (F8)

Rather than selecting tiles independently, the system performs joint selection using a tile-dependency graph. Nodes represent tiles; edges encode:
	•	co-use: tiles often valuable together,
	•	contention coupling: tiles share bottlenecks (same link, same queue, same transform engine),
	•	redundancy/substitution: overlapping effects where selecting both provides diminishing returns.

Tile selection produces a set S^\* that satisfies the budget:
\sum_{i\in S^\*}\text{bytes}_i \le B_{\text{bytes}},
and maximizes total expected benefit under that constraint.

The scoring can be implemented with heuristics or an optional GNN that outputs joint set scores rather than independent scores.

⸻

10) Deadline-constrained prefetch with use-by and telemetry control (F9)

For each selected tile, the system issues a request carrying expiration metadata:
\text{req} = (\text{tile\_id},\ \text{priority},\ \text{use\_by\_t},\ \text{consumer\_layer}).

During execution, telemetry estimates the expected arrival time \widehat{ETA}_i. If:
\widehat{ETA}_i > \text{use\_by\_t},
the request is canceled or demoted, and its reserved bandwidth budget is reallocated to other tiles.

This prevents spending bandwidth on tiles that cannot affect the committed output and reduces bandwidth spikes caused by late, useless transfers.

⸻

11) Transform-on-arrival into microkernel layout (F15)

Tiles may be stored in pooled memory in compressed/quantized form. When a tile arrives in the fast local tile cache, the system immediately applies transform-on-arrival, such as:
	•	dequantization,
	•	decompression,
	•	transpose,
	•	packing/swizzle into microkernel-preferred layout.

This ensures the compute engine can consume the tile without further stalls and makes “arrival” effectively mean “ready to apply.”

⸻

12) Non-materializing accumulation and application (F10)

As each tile becomes ready, the system applies it by computing:
s_i = v_i^\top x,\qquad y \leftarrow y + u_i \cdot s_i.
This is done without rebuilding W, and without recomputing Bx. The output is continuously improved as tiles arrive until the commit rule triggers.

⸻

13) Latency hiding / stall reduction math (F5 + F10 as performance rationale)

Let:
	•	t_B be the time to compute Bx locally,
	•	t_F be the time until the selected tile set arrives ready-to-use (including transfer + transform + queueing),
	•	t_S be stall time waiting for tiles.

Because base compute overlaps fetch, the stall time becomes:
t_S = \max(0,\ t_F - t_B).
If t_B \ge t_F, stall is fully eliminated (t_S=0).

A slide-friendly latency hiding ratio is:
\text{HideRatio} = \frac{\min(t_B,\ t_F)}{t_F},
where HideRatio =1 indicates full hiding, and values closer to 0 indicate poor overlap.

This provides a direct quantitative way to claim reduced GPU stall time.

⸻

14) Deterministic refinement contract (F11)

After the system commits output, additional tiles may still arrive. These late tiles are not used to re-run base compute; they are applied as deterministic deltas:
y \leftarrow y + u_i(v_i^\top x).
To guarantee determinism and prevent duplication, each tile is tracked using:
	•	a tile version number,
	•	an applied-bitset (or equivalent applied state).

Applying the same tile twice is prevented (idempotence), and because contributions are additive, the refinement updates are commutative (order-independent). Outputs can be tagged with a refinement version describing which tiles were included.

⸻

15) Counterfactual value learning loop (F12)

After commit, the system can compute a more refined reference output (from late arrivals or background completion). For each tile i, it computes a counterfactual value signal such as:
	•	\Deltalogit-KL between committed and refined outputs,
	•	improvement in stability margin \Delta m,
	•	or reduction in proxy error.

These signals become training labels to update the tile scoring mechanism, so future steps fetch tiles that historically provided the most benefit per byte in similar contexts.

⸻

16) Multi-accelerator tile directory, deduplication, multicast, fairness (F13)

In multi-accelerator environments, a directory tracks:
\text{tile\_id} \rightarrow \{\text{location(s)},\ \text{version},\ \text{in-flight}\}.
When a tile is already present on a peer accelerator, or already in multicast flight, the system avoids redundant pulls from pooled memory. Fairness throttling prevents one accelerator or tenant from monopolizing pooled bandwidth.

This directly reduces contention-induced variability and improves predictability of fetch completion.

⸻

17) Training-consistent mode with optimizer-state tiles (F14)

In training mode, the forward path can use the same split execution, but correctness requires that tiles needed for exact gradients are available before backward/synchronization. If t_{\text{bwd}} is the backward start time for a layer, the system enforces:
t_{\text{tile\_ready}} \le t_{\text{bwd}}.
Similarly, optimizer-state tiles (e.g., moments) are fetched so they are present for the optimizer update. Tile updates and optimizer-state updates are written back with version increments, without materializing dense W.

⸻

18) Unified arbitration across transfer classes (F16)

A unified arbiter manages the shared traffic budget among:
	•	UV rank-slice tiles,
	•	optimizer-state tiles (training),
	•	and optionally KV/runtime state transfers.

This prevents one class from starving another under shared bandwidth constraints and keeps transfer behavior bounded and predictable.

⸻

Closing statement (what the system achieves)

By combining F1–F16, the system guarantees immediate compute progress via Bx, overlaps pooled-memory transfers with compute to reduce stall time t_S=\max(0,t_F-t_B), commits outputs by deadline using explicit quality gates, and refines deterministically while maintaining multi-accelerator efficiency and training correctness, all without materializing dense weights in fast local memory.

If not ready, it selects more tiles under the byte budget, issues prefetches with use-by times, and cancels any fetch whose predicted ETA > use-by.

After commit, late tiles can apply deterministic refinement (versioned, idempotent).

Training path (must-complete)

Training identifies the required tiles for exact gradients and required optimizer-state tiles.

It prioritizes fetching these tiles to satisfy a must-complete window before backward/sync (no “commit early” rule).

If required tiles aren’t ready, it continues fetching/reprioritizing until they are.

Once ready, it runs backward + sync, performs optimizer update, writes back updated tiles/state with a version bump, and ends the step.

Short PPT summary (2 lines)

Inference: Commit-by-deadline using quality gates (stability/error), fetching only high-value tiles with use-by cancellation to bound tail latency.
Training: Must-complete mode guarantees exact gradients by ensuring required weight/optimizer tiles arrive before backward/sync, then updates and writes back versioned tiles.
